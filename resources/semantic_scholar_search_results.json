    "title": "A Molecular Multimodal Foundation Model Associating Molecule Graphs with Natural Language",
    "abstract": "Although artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant progress in understanding molecules in a wide range of fields, existing models generally acquire the single cognitive ability from the single molecular modality. Since the hierarchy of molecular knowledge is profound, even humans learn from different modalities including both intuitive diagrams and professional texts to assist their understanding. Inspired by this, we propose a molecular multimodal foundation model which is pretrained from molecular graphs and their semantically related textual data (crawled from published Scientific Citation Index papers) via contrastive learning. This AI model represents a critical attempt that directly bridges molecular graphs and natural language. Importantly, through capturing the specific and complementary information of the two modalities, our proposed model can better grasp molecular expertise. Experimental results show that our model not only exhibits promising performance in cross-modal tasks such as cross-modal retrieval and molecule caption, but also enhances molecular property prediction and possesses capability to generate meaningful molecular graphs from natural language descriptions. We believe that our model would have a broad impact on AI-empowered fields across disciplines such as biology, chemistry, materials, environment, and medicine, among others.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have substantially driven scientific progress in various domains, and many papers have demonstrated their ability to tackle complex problems with creative solutions. Our paper introduces a new foundation model, nach0, capable of solving various chemical and biological tasks: biomedical question answering, named entity recognition, molecular generation, molecular synthesis, attributes prediction, and others. nach0 is a multi-domain and multi-task encoder–decoder LLM pre-trained on unlabeled text from scientific literature, patents, and molecule strings to incorporate a range of chemical and linguistic knowledge. We employed instruction tuning, where specific task-related instructions are utilized to fine-tune nach0 for the final set of tasks. To train nach0 effectively, we leverage the NeMo framework, enabling efficient parallel optimization of both base and large model versions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on single-domain and cross-domain tasks. Furthermore, it can generate high-quality outputs in molecular and textual formats, showcasing its effectiveness in multi-domain setups.",

    "title": "Panacea: A foundation model for clinical trial search, summarization, design, and recruitment",
    "abstract": "Clinical trials are fundamental in developing new drugs, medical devices, and treatments. However, they are often time-consuming and have low success rates. Although there have been initial attempts to create large language models (LLMs) for clinical trial design and patient-trial matching, these models remain task-specific and not adaptable to diverse clinical trial tasks. To address this challenge, we propose a clinical trial foundation model named Panacea, designed to handle multiple tasks, including trial search, trial summarization, trial design, and patient-trial matching. We also assemble a large-scale dataset, named TrialAlign, of 793,279 trial documents and 1,113,207 trial-related scientific papers, to infuse clinical knowledge into the model by pre-training. We further curate TrialInstruct, which has 200,866 of instruction data for fine-tuning. These resources enable Panacea to be widely applicable for a range of clinical trial tasks based on user requirements. We evaluated Panacea on a new benchmark, named TrialPanorama, which covers eight clinical trial tasks. Our method performed the best on seven of the eight tasks compared to six cutting-edge generic or medicine-specific LLMs. Specifically, Panacea showed great potential to collaborate with human experts in crafting the design of eligibility criteria, study arms, and outcome measures, in multi-round conversations. In addition, Panacea achieved 14.42% improvement in patient-trial matching, 41.78% to 52.02% improvement in trial search, and consistently ranked at the top for five aspects of trial summarization. Our approach demonstrates the effectiveness of Panacea in clinical trials and establishes a comprehensive resource, including training data, model, and benchmark, for developing clinical trial foundation models, paving the path for AI-based clinical trial development.",

    "abstract": "Pre-trained machine learning (ML) models have shown great performance for a wide range of applications, in particular in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV). Here, we study how pre-training could be used for scientific machine learning (SciML) applications, specifically in the context of transfer learning. We study the transfer behavior of these models as (i) the pre-trained model size is scaled, (ii) the downstream training dataset size is scaled, (iii) the physics parameters are systematically pushed out of distribution, and (iv) how a single model pre-trained on a mixture of different physics problems can be adapted to various downstream applications. We find that-when fine-tuned appropriately-transfer learning can help reach desired accuracy levels with orders of magnitude fewer downstream examples (across different tasks that can even be out-of-distribution) than training from scratch, with consistent behavior across a wide range of downstream examples. We also find that fine-tuning these models yields more performance gains as model size increases, compared to training from scratch on new downstream tasks. These results hold for a broad range of PDE learning tasks. All in all, our results demonstrate the potential of the\"pre-train and fine-tune\"paradigm for SciML problems, demonstrating a path towards building SciML foundation models.

    "title": "Document analysis of the Foundation for a Smoke-Free World’s scientific outputs and activities: a case study in contemporary tobacco industry agnogenesis",
    "abstract": "Background Tobacco corporation Philip Morris International launched the Foundation for a Smoke-Free World (FSFW), a purportedly independent scientific organisation, in 2017. We aimed to systematically investigate FSFW’s activities and outputs, comparing these with previous industry attempts to influence science, as identified in the recently developed typology of corporate influence on science, the Science for Profit Model (SPM). Design We prospectively collected data on FSFW over a 4-year period, 2017–2021, and used document analysis to assess whether FSFW’s activities mirror practices tobacco and other industries have historically used to shape science in their own interests. We used the SPM as an analytical framework, working deductively to search for use of the strategies it identifies, and inductively to search for any additional strategies. Results Marked similarities between FSFW’s practices and previous corporate attempts to influence science were observed, including: producing tobacco industry-friendly research and opinion; obscuring industry involvement in science; funding third parties which denigrate science and scientists that may threaten industry profitability; and promoting tobacco industry credibility. Conclusions Our paper identifies FSFW as a new vehicle for agnogenesis, indicating that, over 70 years since the tobacco industry began to manipulate science, efforts to protect science from its interference remain inadequate. This, combined with growing evidence that other industries are engaging in similar practices, illustrates the urgent need to develop more robust systems to protect scientific integrity.",

    "title": "LMFlow: An Extensible Toolkit for Finetuning and Inference of Large Foundation Models",
    "abstract": "Foundation models have demonstrated a great ability to achieve general human-level intelligence far beyond traditional approaches. As the technique keeps attracting attention from the AI community, more and more foundation models have become publicly available.However, most of those models exhibit a major deficiency in specialized-domain and specialized-task applications, where the step of domain- and task-aware finetuning is still required to obtain scientific language models. As the number of available foundation models and specialized tasks keeps growing, the job of training scientific language models becomes highly nontrivial. In this paper, we take the first step to address this issue. We introduce an extensible and lightweight toolkit, LMFlow, which aims to simplify the domain- and task-aware finetuning of general foundation models.LMFlow offers a complete finetuning workflow for a foundation model to support specialized training with limited computing resources.Furthermore, it supports continuous pretraining, instruction tuning, parameter-efficient finetuning, alignment tuning, inference acceleration, long context generalization, model customization, and even multimodal finetuning, along with carefully designed and extensible APIs. This toolkit has been thoroughly tested and is available at https://github.com/OptimalScale/LMFlow.",

Challenges to foundation model adoption in science threaten to slow progress in such research areas. This study attempted to survey decision support systems and expert system literature to provide insights regarding these challenges. We first reviewed extant literature on these topics to try to identify adoption patterns that would be useful for this purpose. However, this attempt, using a bibliometric approach and a very high level traditional literature review, was unsuccessful due to the overly broad scope of the study. We then surveyed the existing scientific software domain, finding there to be a huge breadth in what constitutes scientific software.However, we do glean some lessons from previous patterns of adoption of scientific software by simply looking at historical examples (e.g., the electronic spreadsheet)",

    "title": "Foundation Models of Scientific Knowledge for Chemistry: Opportunities, Challenges and Lessons Learned",
    "abstract": "Foundation models pre-trained on large corpora demonstrate significant gains across many natural language processing tasks and domains e.g., law, healthcare, education, etc. However, only limited efforts have investigated the opportunities and limitations of applying these powerful models to science and security applications. In this work, we develop foundation models of scientific knowledge for chemistry to augment scientists with the advanced ability to perceive and reason at scale previously unimagined. Specifically, we build large-scale (1.47B parameter) general-purpose models for chemistry that can be effectively used to perform a wide range of in-domain and out-of-domain tasks. Evaluating these models in a zero-shot setting, we analyze the effect of model and data scaling, knowledge depth, and temporality on model performance in context of model training efficiency. Our novel findings demonstrate that (1) model size significantly contributes to the task performance when evaluated in a zero-shot setting; (2) data quality (aka diversity) affects model performance more than data quantity; (3) similarly, unlike previous work, temporal order of the documents in the corpus boosts model performance only for specific tasks, e.g., SciQ; and (4) models pre-trained from scratch perform better on in-domain tasks than those tuned from general-purpose models like Open AI’s GPT-2.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a settlement prediction method based on PSO optimized SVM for improving the accuracy of foundation pit settlement prediction. Firstly, the method uses the SA algorithm to improve the traditional PSO algorithm, and thus, the overall optimization-seeking ability of the PSO algorithm is improved. Secondly, the improved PSO algorithm is used to train the SVM algorithm. Finally, the optimal SVM model is obtained, and the trained model is used in foundation pit settlement prediction. The results suggest that the settling results obtained from the optimized model are closer to the actual values and also more advantageous in indicators such as RMSE. The fitting value R2 = 0.9641, which is greater, indicates a better fitting effect. Thus, it is indicated that the improvement method is feasible.",

    "title": "EXPERIMENTAL JUSTIFICATION OF THE SOIL BASE MODEL FOR THE CALCULATION OF THE COMBINED RAFT-PILE FOUNDATION",
    "abstract": "A new design of a combined raft-pile foundation, which is devoid of the shortcomings of similar existing design solutions and installation methods are proposed. This technical solution has been implemented at one of the construction sites in Kharkiv (Ukraine). The proposed design makes it possible to efficiently use the load-bearing capacity of the soil base by involving the raft part in the response to the loading in a controlled manner with transfer of up to 50% of the total load to this without going beyond the allowable strains of the soil base. The remaining 50% of the load are taken up by piles. The article considers the improved soil base model of the combined raft-pile foundation to consider the nonlinear behavior of the elements “before” and “after” the connection between the raft and the piles (structural nonlinearity) to calculate the stress-strain state using the finite element method in present-day calculation software. Using the improved model makes it possible to qualitatively simulate the behavior of the CRPF with the structural nonlinearity in the behavior of its elements. As a result, we obtain reliable results on the stress-strain state of the base-foundation-structure system. The article presents the modeling and numerical calculation of the \"soil base - combined raft-pile foundation - structure\" system of a real building object by program SOFISTIK using the proposed soil base model and the method of determining its parameters. The comparison and analysis of the results of the numerical calculation and the field experiment of the settlement of the raft part and the initial settlements of the piles of the foundation confirmed the adequacy of the application of the improved soil base model in the form of a combination of two known models: a limited distribution capacity and a Fuss-Winkler and method of determining it parameters on the basis of preliminary pile test. The analysis of the stress-strain state of the combined raft-pile foundation at different stages of the interaction with the proposed soil base model helps to confirm the physical significance of this structural nonlinearity of the behavior of the foundation elements.

    "abstract": "With the advancements in large language model technology, it has showcased capabilities that come close to those of human beings across various tasks. This achievement has garnered significant interest from companies and scientific research institutions, leading to substantial investments in the research and development of these models. While numerous large models have emerged during this period, the majority of them have been trained primarily on English data. Although they exhibit decent performance in other languages, such as Chinese, their potential remains limited due to factors like vocabulary design and training corpus. Consequently, their ability to fully express their capabilities in Chinese falls short. To address this issue, we introduce the model named JIANG (Chinese pinyin of ginger) specifically designed for the Chinese language. We have gathered a substantial amount of Chinese corpus to train the model and have also optimized its structure. The extensive experimental results demonstrate the excellent performance of our model.",

    "title": "Leveraging Foundation Models for Clinical Text Analysis",
    "abstract": "Infectious diseases are a significant public health concern globally, and extracting relevant information from scientific literature can facilitate the development of effective prevention and treatment strategies. However, the large amount of clinical data available presents a challenge for information extraction. To address this challenge, this study proposes a natural language processing (NLP) framework that uses a pre-trained transformer model fine-tuned on task-specific data to extract key information related to infectious diseases from free-text clinical data. The proposed framework includes a data layer for preparing datasets from clinical texts, a foundation model layer for entity extraction, and an assessment layer for performance analysis. The results of the evaluation indicate that the proposed method outperforms standard methods, and leveraging prior knowledge through the pre-trained transformer model makes it useful for investigating other infectious diseases in the future.",

    "title": "Dynamic Analysis of Block-Type Machine Foundation Using Barkan’s Model for Various Soil Parameters",
    "abstract": "Machine foundation involves both the static loads and the dynamic loads caused by working of the machine. The machine weighs several tons and is required to restrict amplitudes to only a few microns. Inadequately constructed foundations may result in failures exceeding many times the cost of the capital investment required for properly designed foundations. This necessitated a deeper scientific investigation of dynamic loading and analysis. Method proposed by Barkan (recommended by IS: 2974-1982) for design of machine foundations under harmonic load, still remains the most popular method for vibration analysis of block foundations in Indian industry. Finite Element (FE) is very commonly accepted analysis tool for solution of engineering problems. Effective Pre and Post-processing capabilities make modeling and result interpretation simple. The current paper aims to do the parametric study of dynamic analysis of block foundation using Barkan’s method. For the same, three different machines of 150 rpm, 250 rpm and 450 rpm are taken into account and six different soil types: (a) Medium, Stiff and Hard Clay and (b) Loose, Medium and Dense Sand are considered. Foundation sizes are optimized according to soil cases and each case is analysed using conventional method and FEM model using STAAD Pro. for 0.8, 1 and 1.2 times the soil parameters to cover the confidence range. This study is further extended for the comparison of concrete quantity consumed. The results grossly show that as the clay varies from medium to hard, and sand from loose to dense, the foundation size required, decreases. It was seen that, with the increase in stiffness of soil, natural frequency of machine foundation soil system increases and amplitude of foundation reduces. Also, FEM method of analysis indicates safer amplitude of foundation compared to classical method of analysis, inferring to conventional method being conservative.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: To investigate the roadbed in the construction of pile foundation united by flexible grillage made of geosynthetic material. To investigate how geosynthetic material will work in such a grillage. To create analytical model of pile foundation with flexible grillage. To determine the strength of such textile material used in the construction. To analyze the advantages and flaws of existing methods for calculating pile foundation structure united by flexible grillage made of geosynthetic material. Methods: Structure parameters of flexible grillage reinforced with geosynthetic material, were calculated using three methodologies: British standard BS 8006-2010, German EBGEO methods, flexible thread calculating method. Results: Arched effect arising in mound body has been studied. Deflections in geosynthetic material were calculated at different loading levels of the structure by soil. Experimental values of forces in geosynthetic material are obtained. \"Critical height\" is set - the distance from pile top which within, arched effect is formed. Numerical value of uniform emptying has been established which at, pile foundation different rigidity is not revealed on surface. The strength of geosynthetic material of flexible grillage of highway mound foundation is estimated. Existing calculation methods for compliance with experiment results are analyzed. Practical importance: Technical solutions have been developed for two types of flexible grillage structures, both, combined and flexible ones with the use of one or more layers of high-strength geotextile with sand in the form of geo-confining. The developed technical solutions meet all requirements of existing regulatory documents and obtained calculated indicators as well as the requirements for strength, reliability and structure durability. The proposed constructions can be recommended for practical use.",

    "abstract": "Abstract According to the deep foundation pit project of Xiaoxihu station on Lanzhou subway Line 1, the three-dimensional finite-element model of the half-cover excavation method of retaining structure is established to simulate the construction of the excavation of the foundation pit. This article analyzes the settling of the surrounding surface, the horizontal displacement and vertical displacement of the retaining pile, the vertical displacement of the shoring column, and the change of the axial force of the inner support and compares them with the actual monitoring data. The results show that for the collapsible loess strata in Lanzhou, the design of retaining pile and inner support is viable. The support form has a good control effect on the deformation of the foundation pit. It keeps the foundation pit stable. The numerical simulation results are more consistent with the actual monitoring data. It provides a basis for the scientific design and construction of a deep foundation pit in the Lanzhou metro station.",

    "abstract": "In order to study the working mechanisms of pile foundations applied to embankment engineering on weak slope foundations, a finite element model of embankment on weak slope foundation reinforced by a pile foundation is established. The influence of the position and the length of the pile foundation on the stability of the embankment is studied, and the mechanical response of the pile foundations are also studied. The results show that the different positions of the pile foundation have great influence on the safety factor and deformation of the embankment. The safety factor varies greatly from one reinforcement location to another. The maximum vertical deformation of the embankment reinforced by the 3 m pile is 27 times that of the 7 m. With different pile lengths, the horizontal displacement of the pile foundation can be significantly reduced by approximately 83.3% at most. The research results may provide more scientific help for the design of embankments on soft soil slopes reinforced by pile foundations.",

    "title": "SEAL: Semantically Enriched Authoring in LATEX—A Model for Scientific Discourse",
    "abstract": "Semantic tags can enrich citation graphs by inter-connecting papers with citation reasons. One of the best sources of knowledge to tell the reason for citation is the author himself. Integrating these reasons in an authoring system can help authors to choose a reason while citing. We examined various Human and Automatic authoring systems for integration of citation reasons. However, to the best of our knowledge, no such system exists that facilities authors to integrate the reasons while citing. Same is the case with Cite Packages. This research proposes integration of CCRO:Citations’ Context and Reasons Ontology’s (Ihsan and Qadir, 2019) taxonomic hierarchy of reasons within document. We have developed a CCRO Package to semantically tag citations with reasons and to create an intra-discourse relation between research articles. Furthermore, embedding these structures within RDF Data Store enables the creation of knowledge graphs that become a foundation artifact for the Semantic & Scientific Discourse.",

    "abstract": "In order to effectively predict the settlement of soft soil foundation, improve the accuracy of road soft soil foundation settlement prediction, and improve the safety of the project, this paper proposes an optimized SVM-AR model and discusses the application scope of the SVM model and the time series AR model, respectively. The SVM-AR model is proposed by combining the respective advantages of the two types of models. Firstly, the prediction method of foundation settlement is analyzed and studied, and then the improved ABC algorithm is used to optimize the SVM model. Secondly, the optimized SVM model is combined with the AR model, the ABC-SVM model is used to predict the trend settlement, and the AR model is used to predict the random settlement and then combined to obtain the predicted settlement. The example verification shows that SVM-AR is more accurate than the SVM model prediction results and better reflects the settlement process of highway soft soil foundation.",

Despite its popularity, this idea is less explored in improving the LLMs to align existing foundation models with scientific disciplines, concepts and goals. In this work, we present SciTune as a tuning framework to improve the ability of LLMs to follow scientific multimodal instructions. To test our methodology, we use a human-generated scientific instruction tuning dataset and train a large multimodal model LLaMA-SciTune that connects a vision encoder and LLM for science-focused visual and language understanding. In comparison to the models that are finetuned with machine generated data only, LLaMA-SciTune surpasses human performance on average and in many sub-categories on the ScienceQA benchmark.",

    "title": "Risk Assessment of Constructing Deep Foundation Pits for Metro Stations Based on Fuzzy Evidence Reasoning and Two-tuple Linguistic Analytic Network Process",
    "abstract": "Accidents occur frequently while constructing deep foundation pits for metro stations, thereby risking substantial economic losses and casualties. To subject the construction of such pits to scientific and rational risk assessment and overcome the limitations of existing risk evaluation models and risk fusion problems, proposed here is a risk-assessment model for such pits based on fuzzy evidential reasoning and the two-tuple linguistic analytic network process (TL-ANP). First, the risk loss indicators are optimized, the weights of different risk events and of each risk loss indicator in the metro-station deep-foundation-pit construction project are calculated using TL-ANP, and trapezoidal fuzzy numbers are used to describe the occurrence probability of each risk event and loss. Second, relying on a table of expert weight indices, the best–worst method based on generalized interval-valued trapezoidal fuzzy numbers is used to determine the weights of experts. Finally, the overall risk grade of the construction project is evaluated by aggregating the risk levels of all risk events through an evidence-reasoning algorithm. The analysis results for a deep foundation pit for a station on Line 5 of Nanning Metro show that the model provides a quantitative basis for determining expert weights and risk loss weights reasonably and improving the reliability of the evaluation system. Also, not only does applying the method show that such a construction project can be judged as having a certain risk grade, but more importantly it can identify the key factors and loss indicators affecting the overall risk grade of the pit, whereupon risk control measures can be adopted in a targeted manner. In comparison with traditional methods, the proposed method is shown to be practical and effective, providing a reference basis for analyzing the risks of similar projects in the future and guaranteeing construction safety.",

    "title": "Coupling the Calibrated GlobalLand30 Data and Modified PLUS Model for Multi-Scenario Land Use Simulation and Landscape Ecological Risk Assessment",
    "abstract": "Rapid economic growth and urbanization have significantly changed the land use distribution and landscape ecological structure, which has a profound impact on the natural environment. A scientific grasp of the characteristics of land use distribution and its impact on landscape ecological risk is a prerequisite for sustainable urban development. This study aimed to calibrate GlobalLand30 data using the normalized difference impervious surface index (NDISI) obtained from Landsat images, thereby providing a more precise foundation for land simulation. Additionally, it sought to improve the accuracy of the patch-generating land use simulation (PLUS) through parameter sensitivity analysis. Building upon this, the research also simulates future land use in Beijing. Lastly, this study introduced an LER index to assess ecological risk in the current and future urban landscapes. The results showed that the GlobalLand30 data were calibrated and PLUS model accuracy was improved to more than 86%. The accuracy of the modified PLUS model based on a Morris sensitivity analysis was increased, and the kappa coefficients were increased by approximately 3%. The results of the multi-scenario simulation showed that under the SSP126-EP scenario, future land use in Beijing could balance urban development and ecological protection, and thus would be more suitable for sustainable development. In the other two scenarios, ecological land will be encroached by urban development. From 2000 to 2020, the degree of LER was generally lower, moderate, or higher, and the overall level of LER showed a downward trend continuing until 2100 in the SSP126-EG scenario. Future land use simulations and LER assessment under multi-scenarios could help decision makers develop multi-scale landscape protection strategies.",

    "title": "A novel QLattice‐based whitening machine learning model of landslide susceptibility mapping",
    "abstract": "Landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) enables the prediction of landslide occurrences, thereby offering a scientific foundation for disaster prevention and control. In recent years, numerous studies have been conducted on LSM using machine learning techniques. However, the majority of machine learning models is considered “black box” models due to their lack of transparent explanations. In contrast, the QLattice model serves as a white box model, as it can elucidate the decision‐making mechanism while representing a novel approach to whitening machine learning models. QLattice possesses the capability to automatically select and scale data features. In this study, Fengjie County in China was selected as the research area, with slope units serving as evaluation units. A geospatial database was constructed using 12 conditioning factors, including elevation, slope, and annual average rainfall. LSM models were conducted using both the QLattice and random forest (RF) algorithms. The findings demonstrate that the QLattice model achieved an area under curve value of 0.868, while the RF model attained an area under curve value of 0.849 for the test datasets. These results highlight the superior predictive ability and stability of the QLattice model compared with RF. Furthermore, QLattice can explicate and clarify the change processes of conditioning factors, thereby revealing the internal decision‐making mechanism and causes behind the LSM model's decisions. The innovative QLattice‐based model provides new ideas and methodologies for LSM research.",

    "title": "Digital education in the social investment model of Gross Domestic Product growth in the context of Industry 4.0",
    "abstract": "The motivation for this research was the desire to disclose the potential for human potential development that is created by Industry 4.0. The goal of this paper is to study the modern international experience and prospects for implementing the social investment model of economic growth under the conditions of Industry 4.0 with the help of the development of digital education. The method of regression analysis is used to model the econometric dependence of human development on digital education in 2019–2021. The paper’s contribution to the literature consists in the development of scientific provisions of the concept of the social investment model of economic growth through reconsidering the approach to human potential development with the help of education under the conditions of Industry 4.0. Unlike the existing approach, which implies the foundation on traditional (pre-digital) education, this paper offers a new approach to human potential development under the conditions of Industry 4.0, which is based on digital education. The advantage of the authors’ approach is its allowing for the fullest use of new opportunities that open under the conditions of Industry 4.0. The main conclusion of this research is that under the conditions of Industry 4.0, the social investment model of economic growth should be based on digital education. The theoretical significance of the results obtained lies in their allowing reconsidering the role of education in the implementation of the social investment model of economic growth under the conditions of Industry 4.0. It is proved that this role is performed most successfully with the help of digital education. The practical significance of the conclusions is due to the fact that implementation of the authors’ recommendations will allow balancing the level of human development in the countries of distinguished categories: countries with the highest Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate; countries with the highest level of human development; countries with the most developed digital education. The social significance of the paper consists in its support for the practical implementation of SDG 4, SDG 8, and SDG 10.",

    "title": "Simulation Analysis of Land-Use Spatial Conflict in a Geopark Based on the GMOP–Markov–PLUS Model: A Case Study of Yimengshan Geopark, China",
    "abstract": "The foundation for accurately understanding regional land-use structures and pursuing the coordination of human–land relations is the scientific identification and simulation of temporal and spatial evolution patterns of land-use spatial conflict (LUSC). Based on the production–living–ecological space (PLES) perspective, a land-use spatial conflict identification and intensity diagnosis model (LUCSII) was constructed using a landscape ecology index. The methods of geographic information system (GIS), spatial autocorrelation analysis, and mathematical statistics were used to achieve the spatial pattern of LUSC over the last 20 years, and the GMOP–Markov–PLUS model was used to simulate the evolution of LUSC in the future under various scenarios. The results indicated that our established LUCSII could accurately identify potential land-use spatial conflict areas in geoparks. The GMOP–Markov–PLUS model constructed had also scientifically predicted the future land-use patterns under different scenarios, successfully demonstrating the changing process of spatial conflict pattern evolution. The research proposed three different plans for the long-term land use of YG, including ecological protection, economic development, and long-term development perspectives. Finally, the research further emphasized the importance for sustainable development of geoparks. More attention should be paid to the optimal allocation of land-use structure and the coordinated development of human–land relationships.",

    "title": "Building a Logic Model to Foster Engagement and Learning Using the Case of a Province-Wide Multispecies Antimicrobial Use Monitoring System",
    "abstract": "Successfully designing and implementing a program is complex; it requires a reflexive balance between the available resources and the priorities of various stakeholders, both of which change over time. Logic models are theory-based evaluation approaches used to identify and address key challenges of a program. This article describes the process of building a logic model on advanced theories in complexity studies. The models aim to support a province-wide multispecies monitoring system of antimicrobial use (AMU), designed in collaboration with the animal health sector in Quebec (Canada). Based on a rigorous theoretical foundation, the logic model is built in three steps: (1) mapping, a narrative review of literature on similar programs in other jurisdictions; (2) framing, iterative consultations with project members to elaborate the logic model; (3) shaping, hypotheses based on the logic model. The model emerges from the reflexive balancing of current scientific knowledge and empirical insights to gather relevant information about stakeholders from interdisciplinary experts that led a 3-year consensus-building process within the community. Recognizing the challenge of unpacking theories for practical use, we illustrate how the process of an “open” logic model building could enable governance coordination in complex processes. Logic models are useful for evaluating public, private, and academic partnerships in One Health programs that characterize an adaptive governance process.",

    "abstract": "Urban transportation issues continue to emerge and evolve as a result of rapid urbanization, and the systematic and scientific assessment of urban mobility is becoming increasingly essential. In this work, a Pressure-State-Response (PSR) model with 25 indicators was established to reflect the status of urban mobility. Then, the importance of indicators was determined with the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (IVIF-AHP) method, and the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation (FCE) method was applied to assess the overall status of urban mobility. The validity of the proposed model was demonstrated using the mobility system of Beijing as a case study, and the pressure, state, and response scores were calculated. The proposed assessment model can help to improve urban transportation monitoring and can also provide a scientific foundation for future urban transportation policymaking, planning, and traffic management, thereby further ensuring the sustainable development of urban transportation systems.",

    "title": "Site Quality Evaluation Model of Chinese Fir Plantations for Machine Learning and Site Factors",
    "abstract": "Site quality evaluation is an important foundation for decision-making and planning in forest management and provides scientific decision support and guidance for the sustainable development of forests and commercial plantations. Site index and site form models were constructed and subsequently compared utilizing fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) plantations in Nanping City, Fujian Province, China. This papers aim was to construct a site quality classification model, conduct further analysis on the effects of different site factors on the quality of the site, and achieve an assessment of site quality for Chinese fir plantations. An algebraic difference approach was used to establish a site index model and a site form model for Chinese fir in Fujian Province. The suitability of the two models was compared using model accuracy analysis and partial correlation, and the optimal model was chosen for classifying the site quality of the stands. On this basis, a site quality classification model was established using the random forest algorithm, and the importance of each site factor was determined through importance ranking in terms of their impact on site quality. Within the study area, the R2 of the site index model results was 0.581, and the R2 values of the five site form models based on different reference breast diameters, ranked from high to low, were 0.894, 0.886, 0.884, 0.880, and 0.865. The bias correlation coefficient between site form and stand volume was 0.71, and the bias correlation coefficient between site index and stand volume was 0.52. The results confirmed that the site form model is better suited for evaluating the site quality of Chinese fir plantations. The random forest-based site form classification model had a high classification accuracy with a generalization accuracy of 0.87. The factors that had the greatest impact on site form were altitude, canopy closure, and slope gradient, whereas landform had the smallest impact on site form. These results can provide a reference for the evaluation of the site quality of plantations and natural forests in southern China to ensure the long-term sustainable use of forest resources.",

    "title": "Rural Redemption: A Model to Help Understand the Perspectives of Rural Americans Related to Vaccine Science",
    "abstract": "Abstract Rural communities are vital to the foundation of American agriculture and are currently disproportionately affected by health and environmental challenges that will require broad scientific solutions. Cooperative Extension professionals and agricultural communicators are increasingly tasked with communicating about the science surrounding these topics and need effective tools for determining strategic communication tactics to influence personal behaviors. The purpose of this study was to understand the role of community-based social marketing (CBSM) concepts and trust in science on rural Americans’ intentions and attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine. A hypothesized model was developed that included concepts of CBSM, trust in science, intentions, and attitudes all related to the COVID-19 vaccine. Results showed that CBSM principles had significant explanatory power for predicting intentions to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. CBSM and trust in science were also significant predictors of rural Americans attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine. Implications for this study reveal a need for future research and practice related to communicating about science and vaccines to rural Americans while building community-based principles for increasing trust and advancing perceptions of science. Future research should determine the impact of CBSM and trust in science on the end-state behavior of receiving the vaccine. Additionally, Extension professionals and agricultural communicators should prioritize CBSM concepts when developing programming and messages related to health behaviors.",

However, traditional scholar evaluation methods based solely on individual achievements do not consider interdisciplinary cooperation, creating a challenge for interdisciplinary scholar evaluation and recommendation. To address this issue, we propose a scholar embedding model that quantifies and represents scholars based on global semantic information and social influence, enabling real-time tracking of scholars’ research trends. Our model incorporates semantic information and social influence for interdisciplinary scholar evaluation, laying the foundation for future interdisciplinary collaboration discovery and recommendation projects. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on a sample of scholars from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications.",

    "abstract": "The pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for a terrible health devastation with profoundly harmful consequences for the economic, social and political activities of communities on a global scale. Extraordinary efforts have been made by the world scientific community, who, in solidarity, shared knowledge so that effective vaccines could be produced quickly. However, it is still important to study therapies that can reduce the risk, until group immunity is reached, which, globally, will take a time that is still difficult to predict. On the other hand, the immunity time guaranteed by already approved vaccines is still uncertain. The current study proposes a therapy whose foundation lies in the important role that innate immunity may have, by preventing the disease from progressing to the acute phase that may eventually lead to the patient's death. Our focus is on NK cells and their relevant role. Natural killer cells (NK) are considered the primary defence lymphocytes against virus-infected cells. They play a critical role in modulating the immune system. Preliminary studies in COVID-19 patients with severe disease, suggest a reduction in the number and function of NK cells, resulting in decreased clearance of infected and activated cells and unchecked elevation of inflammation markers that damage tissue. SARS-CoV-2 infection distorts the immune response towards a highly inflammatory phenotype. Restoring the effector functions of NK cells has the potential to correct the delicate immune balance needed to effectively overcome SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

    "title": "Peer-based research funding as a model for journalism funding",
    "abstract": "Financing high-quality journalistic reporting is becoming increasingly difficult worldwide and economic pressure has intensified in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. While numerous alternative funding possibilities are discussed, ranging from membership models to government funding, they should not compromise the highest possible independence of journalism – a premise that also applies to scientific research. Here, the state is involved in funding, but peer review models reduce funding bias. However, systematic approaches as to how established funding models in research could be transferred to journalism are lacking. We attempt such a systematic transfer using the example of the German Research Foundation ( Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG). The transfer, based on an analysis of the complex DFG funding structures, was validated in 10 interviews with experts from science, journalism and foundations. Building on this, we developed a concept for a German Journalism Foundation ( Deutsche Journalismus-gemeinschaft, DJG), which awards funding to journalists and cooperative projects based on a peer review process. The funding priorities of the proposed organization range from infrastructure support to grants for investigative skills. Thus, unlike other models, it does not focus on funding specific topics in media coverage, but on areas such as innovation support, technology implementation and training. Although the model was designed for Germany, such a systematic transfer could also be tested for other countries.",

His research on the pathology of inflammation, the phylogeny of hematopoiesis, and the cyto- and histophysiology of connective tissue, he performed by experimental-histological and cultural methods more than 110 years ago. Their results made it possible to approve the dominance of the monophyletic model of hematopoiesis, to develop the doctrine of the reticuloendothelial system, and to obtain valuable data on the concept of mesenchymal reserve in the tissues of an adult organism.A.A. Maximow lived a short but extremely busy life. Many of his breakthrough results became the starting point for development by his immediate employees and ideological successors; among them are outstanding names: N.N. Anichkov, N.G. Khlopin, A.A. Zavarzin, V.M. Danchakova and other prominent researchers.Key achievements of A.A.

The justification for the work is the growing number of qualitative researches and the scarcity of objetive evaluation methods for this kind of research. The theoretical foundation is the quality literature of qualitative research. The method employed is ELECTRE TRI because it meets the requirements of the problem analyzed, such as multiple criteria and problematic classification. In modeling, seven criteria (theoretical consistency, relevance of the search, data fidelity, transferability of the results, credibility of the results, textual and ethical clarity) and three classes (accepted, revise and resubmit and rejected) were defined. The validation of the model was carried out with a specialist in qualitative methods, who also defined the test parameters. The model was tested with ten qualitative articles published in annals of a national scientific event following the parameters pre-established by the specialist. The results show that the model ranked the ten articles among the three predefined classes, with only one article reaching the \"approved\" class. The model can be used by scientific journals to standardize the process of evaluating qualitative research and to help the preparation of opinions.",

    "title": "EVHF-GCN: An Emergency Vehicle Priority Scheduling Model Based on Heterogeneous Feature Fusion With Graph Convolutional Networks",
    "abstract": "Traffic flow prediction is a crucial aspect of Intelligent Transport Systems, offering a scientific foundation for urban transport system management and planning. However, predicting traffic flow becomes challenging due to its susceptibility to diverse static and dynamic external factors, such as the presence of emergency vehicles that necessitate priority treatment in the road network. To tackle this issue, this paper introduces an Emergency Vehicle Priority Scheduling Model based on Heterogeneous Feature Fusion in Graph Convolutional Networks (EVHF-GCN). This model concurrently considers road network and emergency vehicle information, dynamically adjusting signal control strategies based on traffic flow prediction outcomes. This approach ensures the prioritized passage of emergency vehicles and mitigates traffic congestion. The model utilizes a heterogeneous feature fusion mechanism within a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to propagate features and aggregate information from intersection nodes. It also integrates a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network to capture dynamic traffic flow features. Additionally, we propose a Dynamic Signal Control Strategy (DSCS) that determines intersection green light durations based on prediction results and selects different control strategies as per the situation. Experimental results demonstrate that the model enhances traffic flow prediction accuracy and improves traffic system efficiency and safety in scenarios with and without emergency vehicles.",

    "title": "Performance Evaluation of Railway Infrastructure Managers: A Novel Hybrid Fuzzy MCDM Model",
    "abstract": "Modern challenges such as the liberalization of the railway sector and growing demands for sustainability, high-quality services, and user satisfaction set new standards in railway operations. In this context, railway infrastructure managers (RIMs) play a crucial role in ensuring innovative approaches that will strengthen the position of railways in the market by enhancing efficiency and competitiveness. Evaluating their performance is essential for assessing the achieved objectives, and it is conducted through a wide range of key performance indicators (KPIs), which encompass various dimensions of operations. Monitoring and analyzing KPIs are crucial for improving service quality, achieving sustainability, and establishing a foundation for research and development of new strategies in the railway sector. This paper provides a detailed overview and evaluation of KPIs for RIMs. This paper creates a framework for RIM evaluation using various scientific methods, from identifying KPIs to applying complex analysis methods. A novel hybrid model, which integrates the fuzzy Delphi method for aggregating expert opinions on the KPIs’ importance, the extended fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method for determining the relative weights of these KPIs, and the ADAM method for ranking RIMs, has been developed in this paper. This approach enables a detailed analysis and comparison of RIMs and their performances, providing the basis for informed decision-making and the development of new strategies within the railway sector. The analysis results provide insight into the current state of railway infrastructure and encourage further efforts to improve the railway sector by identifying key areas for enhancement. The main contributions of the research include a detailed overview of KPIs for RIMs and the development of a hybrid multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) model. The hybrid model represents a significant step in RIM performance analysis, providing a basis for future research in this area. The model is universal and, as such, represents a valuable contribution to MCDM theory.",

    "title": "The Construction of Accurate Recommendation Model of Learning Resources of Knowledge Graph under Deep Learning",
    "abstract": "With the rapid development of science and technology and the continuous progress of teaching, it is now flooded with rich learning resources. Massive learning resources provide learners with a good learning foundation. At the same time, learners want to be precise from many learning resources. Second, it becomes more and more difficult to quickly obtain the learning resources you want. Therefore, it is very important to accurately and quickly recommend learning resources to learners. During the last two decades, a large number of different types of recommendation systems were adopted that present the users with contents of their choice, such as videos, products, and educational content recommendation systems. The knowledge graph has been fully applied in this process. The application of deep learning in the recommendation systems has further enhanced their performance. This article proposes a learning resource accurate recommendation model based on the knowledge graph under deep learning. We build a recommendation system based on deep learning that is comprised of a learner knowledge representation (KR) model and a learning resource KR model. Information such as learner’s basic information, learning resource information, and other data is used by the recommendation engine to calculate the target learner’s score based on the learner KR and the learning resource KR and generate a recommendation list for the target learner. We use mean absolute error (MAE) as the evaluation indicator. The experimental results show that the proposed recommendation system achieves better results as compared to the traditional systems.",

    "title": "Evidence-Based Policing as a Foundational Policing Model for the INP",
    "abstract": "In the midst of various challenges of policing and its consequences on public trust, a number of studies have examined the duties of the Police, especially the Republic of Indonesia National Police (INP), in maintaining security and public order, enforcing the law, protecting the public, and serving the community. Several contemporary policing models, such as Community Policing or Problem-Oriented Policing, have been suggested and implemented by the INP, although the parameters of its successful implementation continue to be a questionable issue. This article discusses how the concept of Evidence-Based Policing (EBP) – a new paradigm in policing – can better serve as a foundation for the Police in dealing with societal and criminal issues. EBP emphasises scientific and evidence-based decision-making, enabling officers to avoid the biases that are frequently criticised in policing practices. By utilising literature review and document analysis methods, this article examines existing policing models and demonstrates the importance of evidence-based approaches in improving INP performance. It also highlights the importance of consulting and collaborating with pracademics and international institutions that have successfully implemented EBP, in order to increase the accountability and responsibility of the INP in implementing EBP. The implementation of EBP is expected to lead to positive changes in policing culture – providing more effective and comprehensive solutions based on data and scientific studies to address crime and social problems in the community.",

    "abstract": "Abstract. Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced, demonstrating near-human intelligence in language comprehension, problem-solving, and autonomous decision-making, which can be leveraged in scientific discovery. Previous research of LLM for science often focuses on experiment execution part and the first stage of research, i.e., idea generation with large language models is lack of research. This paper fills this gap by surveying the use of LLM-based agent systems in research idea generation. This research first proposes three stages in research idea generation pipeline, pre-ideation (knowledge preparation), ideation (generation and iteration), post-ideation (evaluation), and provide detailed summary in different methods in each stage, then it summarizes different metrics and angles of evaluating generated research ideas, finally it discusses limitations and ethical concerns of existing works and suggest potential solutions and future directions. These results aim to provide a solid foundation for future research in improving LLM-based ideation systems and fostering responsible AI usage in scientific discovery.",

    "abstract": "Congestion and complexity in the field of highway transportation have risen steadily in recent years, particularly because the growth rate of vehicles has far outpaced the growth rate of roads and other transportation facilities. To ensure smooth traffic, reduce traffic congestion, improve road safety, and reduce the negative impact of air pollution on the environment, an increasing number of traffic management departments are turning to new scientifically developed technology. The urban road traffic is simulated by nodes and sidelines in this study, which is combined with graph theory, and the information of real-time changes of road traffic is added to display and calculate the relevant data and parameters in the road. On this foundation, the dynamic path optimization algorithm model is discussed in the context of high informationization. Although the improved algorithm’s optimal path may not be the conventional shortest path, its actual travel time is the shortest, which is more in line with users’ actual travel needs to a large extent.",

    "abstract": "Psychology-based music education is an interdisciplinary field that incorporates pedagogy, psychology, and other academic fields. A stronger communication link between students and students can be created by incorporating music education psychology into college instruction. In order to provide a scientific foundation for the development of psychology of music education in colleges and universities, it is currently urgently necessary to break free from the constraints of methodology, give importance to both quantitative and qualitative research, and gradually develop diversified research methods. The study of positive psychology is still evolving. From the early psychological movement to the present, it has grown into a hugely significant profession. As a result, this essay presents the findings from research on psychologically based school music instruction reform and development remedies. In the end, Class B has more students with scores of 50 to 60, whereas Class A has more students with scores of 90 to 100, which is quite a contrast. The average grade for students in class A is 80.125, while that for students in class B is 71.45. The lowest Class B score is 51, the lowest Class A score is 58, and the maximum score in A is 98. It is clear that a crucial aspect is the sensible and appropriate use of psychiatric treatment.",

    "abstract": "Cross-border e-commerce has greatly promoted the development of China’s foreign trade, and the cross-border e-commerce comprehensive pilot area (CBECCPA, in brief) is the main form for promoting the development of cross-border e-commerce. The study aims to find out what factors and to what extent these factors affect the development of the CBECCPAs. Adopting the structural equation model analysis (AMOS) method and the data in 2017 of the 35 CBECCPAs set in the former three batches in China, the paper studies the effects of four main factors, including economic foundation, telecommunication network foundation, e-commerce logistics, and scientific and technological innovation, on the development of the CBECCPAs. The empirical results show that the economic foundation of the city where a CBECCPA locates has a vital impact, scientific and technological innovation has a quite important effect, e-commerce logistics has an important impact, and telecommunications network foundation has a slight influence on the development of CBECCPA. On the basis of empirically analysis results, it is suggested to strive to develop the cities’ economy, increase investment in scientific and technological development, attach importance to scientific and technological innovation, and perfect the urban logistics system. Some suggestions are put forward, such as to make great efforts to develop the economy sustainably, to encourage to scientific and technological innovation, and to improve the logistics system. It is meaningful for the construction and development of the fourth and fifth batches of CBECCPAs.",

In conducting this examination, the article draws attention to the strengths of the Triple Helix Model, the communication overlay, fourth selection environment and associated ecology of the meta-stabilisation it posits not as the Quadruple Helix, but N-Tuple helices of a higher-order policy model. That policy model which stands high in terms of the status it commands as a regime governing the transition to a next-order system. To a next-order system whose governing regime commands this heightened status as the model policy for nation-states to adopt in sustaining the economic growth of regions.",

    "abstract": "As an important section for controlling hospital infection, the main responsibility of the sterilization supply room is to clean, disinfect, sterilize, store, and distribute all medical devices that need to be reused in the hospital, and the quality of its work is closely related to the normal work of the hospital. Disinfection and supply department is the premise and foundation of the hospital department, mainly responsible for the recovery, cleaning, disinfection, sterilization, storage, and distribution of medical devices. The cleaning and disinfection work is characterized by strong technicality and high requirements, and the work effect is directly related to the safety of patients' lives and the occurrence of hospital infections. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a scientific and efficient management mode to be applied to the work of the supply room. The traditional management mode has some drawbacks, which affects the actual work of the hospital. Disinfection and supply rooms are an important part of hospital infection control and an important department to ensure the quality of health care. An effective management mode can not only improve the efficiency but also the overall quality of work, and PDCA (plan-do-check action cycle) as an advanced management mode can effectively improve the quality of management. This study investigates the effect of PDCA cycle management based on artificial intelligence algorithms in the nursing management of sterile supply rooms, and the experimental results show that the algorithm model can effectively reduce the incidence of adverse events and improve the rate of sterilization standards, which has certain practical significance.",

    "abstract": "Continuing the study, the purpose of which was to develop a new approach to determining the transport behaviour of residents of urban agglomerations, to outline the main ways of its development, a new description of transport behaviour is proposed based on various scientific disciplines and the theory of macrosystems.This, according to the authors, will make contribution to laying the foundation for creation of a currently missing theory of transport behaviour.A developed mathematical model of transport behaviour based on the provisions of academician Yu. S. Popkov’s theory of macrosystems, uses the entropy approach to determine the equilibrium state of the transport system. At the same time, the model identifies an initial list of parameters responsible for describing the «transport behaviour». The latter is considered as a collective phenomenon that creates a deterministic representation resulting from interaction of many stochastically acting elements (road users). A compiled preliminary scheme can be used to solve the problem of finding unknowns in the system of equations and inequalities within the model.",

    "title": "Tractor Cab Ergonomics Optimization Based on the Simplified Model of Upper Limb from the Perspective of Public Health",
    "abstract": "The study of tractor ergonomics is both an essential part of public health and a very significant part of the scientific community's focus at the moment. It offers a foundation for the layout design of the tractor cab, making it possible to effectively avoid occupational diseases, minimize the number of safety accidents, and enhance the comfort of operation. Devices are categorized as control rod devices, knob-type devices, and steering wheels according to the various modes of operation of the tractor cab. Steering wheels are also included. The ease of handling of a number of different components was ranked according to how well they performed on the fast evaluation approach for the upper limbs. After that, in accordance with the concept that underpins this evaluation approach, the comfortable range of motion of human upper limb joints is evaluated while undergoing a variety of manipulation modalities. In conjunction with the structure of the human body and the characteristics of its movement, a streamlined point-line structure model of the human upper limb is constructed, with the H-point serving as the reference point. The problem of figuring out how to distribute the control components in the best possible way has been solved, and the optimal distribution range diagram of the steering wheel has been obtained. The ideal height for the distribution of control rod devices is around 300–400 millimeters, whereas the ideal height for the distribution of knob-type devices is approximately 200–500 millimeters. In conclusion, the cab design of the KAT2204 tractor is improved upon thanks to the analysis done in this study, which can be found above. The legitimacy of the research conclusion is confirmed by the fact that the RULA value is lower than 2, which is proved by the fact that the design findings are validated by the Creo Manikin module. The ergonomics of the tractor cab were taken into consideration when using this research approach as a reference.",

    "title": "Landscape architecture design as an art creative practice: A studio teaching model",
    "abstract": "Landscape Architecture is defined as a blend of art and science. However, it has been acknowledged that configuration of design forms, which is related to spatial composition and element forms is the most challenging design aspect that the students face in learning the design process in the basic design course. This is not the case for the scientific aspects where students can establish their ability and confidence in learning landscape technical issues and functional requirements. This paper discusses the outcomes of the first Landscape Architecture Design Studio at the Department of Landscape Architecture at Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University (IAU), which represents the first foundation stone for Landscape Architecture design education. The Landscape Architecture Studio has examined the role of creative practice in art plays in the landscape architecture design process in the light of Zangwill’s Aesthetic Creation Theory (ACT), and following the Form-Based Design (FBD) approach process defined by Stefano Fillipi. In this studio, students were asked to design a private garden related to, hypothetically, an artist’s family house. Based on the FBD approach, each student chose a specific modern artist, supposedly owning the garden house, and studied his artistic principles of forms, patterns, colours and composition, and used them as an inspiration for their own art paintings. The students’ art pieces acted as the basis for conceptualising their design preliminary plans and 3D images. As a result of this studio, students showed a great interest in the studio artistic approach, and demonstrated a significant ability to translate the artistic principles and qualities existing in creative painting successfully into their landscape architecture design. At the end of the teaching process, a reflective student survey feedback from instructors indicated that students had learned about the aesthetic creative approach and were able to understand the role non-aesthetic properties played into manifesting the design aesthetic quality.",

    "abstract": "Solid waste disposal is significantly important to maintain normal operation of both natural and artificial ecosystems. In this study, a kinetic model of solid waste treatment unit (SWTU) was upfront developed based on microbial ecology, system dynamics, cybernetics and digital simulation, which accurately described the relationships and interactions between solid waste decomposition (SWD) processes and biotic/abiotic factors. Then a specific SWTU prototype was designed and built from this kinetic model. A 370-day experiment demonstrated that SWTU maintained normal operation with robust stability and desired dynamic behaviors, and effectively disposed the solid waste. Therefore, this kinetic model was highly valid due to its high structural and behavioral similarity with the prototype. This research could lay a strong theoretical foundation for further closed-loop control and optimization of SWTU, and provide scientific guidance to environmental management and sustainable development.",

    "abstract": "We seek to transform how new and emergent variants of pandemic-causing viruses, specifically SARS-CoV-2, are identified and classified. By adapting large language models (LLMs) for genomic data, we build genome-scale language models (GenSLMs) which can learn the evolutionary landscape of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. By pre-training on over 110 million prokaryotic gene sequences and fine-tuning a SARS-CoV-2-specific model on 1.5 million genomes, we show that GenSLMs can accurately and rapidly identify variants of concern. Thus, to our knowledge, GenSLMs represents one of the first whole-genome scale foundation models which can generalize to other prediction tasks. We demonstrate scaling of GenSLMs on GPU-based supercomputers and AI-hardware accelerators utilizing 1.63 Zettaflops in training runs with a sustained performance of 121 PFLOPS in mixed precision and peak of 850 PFLOPS. We present initial scientific insights from examining GenSLMs in tracking evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, paving the path to realizing this on large biological data.",

    "title": "Analysis of ischemic stroke burden in Asia from 1990 to 2019: based on the global burden of disease 2019 data",
    "abstract": "Background Ischemic stroke has the characteristics of high morbidity, mortality, and recurrence rate. This study aimed to describe and assess the burden of ischemic stroke in Asia based on the global burden of disease (GBD) 2019 data and provide a crucial scientific foundation for the prevention and control of this life-threatening disease. Method This study used the GBD 2019 data to assess the burden of ischemic stroke. The indicators used in this study were derived from the following methods: (i) the incidence of ischemic stroke was estimated using the disability model for the global burden of disease study-mixed effects regression (DisMod-MR), a Bayesian meta-regression disease modeling tool; (ii) the non-specific codes of all available data on mortality were corrected and used to estimate mortality rates for ischemic stroke and the cause of death ensemble model was used to estimate mortality rates; and (iii) the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) is the sum of years lived with disability (YLD) and the years of life lost (YLL), which quantifies the health loss due to specific diseases and injuries. In addition, the joinpoint regression model was adopted to analyze the temporal trend of ischemic stroke from 1990 to 2019 in Asia. Result This study found an increase in the burden of ischemic stroke in 2019 compared to 1990. Moreover, the age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) of ischemic stroke showed a gradual upward trend over the specific period. The age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) showed a downward trend in Asia from 1990 to 2019. The burden of ischemic stroke was more concentrated on older age groups, particularly those older than 65 years. East Asia had the highest burden of ischemic stroke compared to other regions in Asia. Particularly, China, India, Indonesia, and Japan had the highest burdens of ischemic stroke among the Asian countries and regions. However, the population with the highest burden of ischemic stroke was still the elderly group. Conclusion Based on our study, it is evident that the burden of ischemic stroke exists substantially and exhibits variations in the aspects of age, gender, and geographical region in Asia. Without targeted implementation of population-wide primary strategies for prevention and control, the burden of ischemic stroke is likely to worsen significantly in the future.",

    "abstract": "Ocean modeling is a powerful tool for simulating the physical, chemical, and biological processes of the ocean, which is the foundation for marine science research and operational oceanography. Modern numerical ocean modeling mainly consists of governing equations and numerical algorithms. Nonlinear instability, computational expense, low reusability efficiency and high coupling costs have gradually become the main bottlenecks for the further development of numerical ocean modeling. Recently, artificial intelligence-based modeling in scientific computing has shown revolutionary potential for digital twins and scientific simulations, but the bottlenecks of numerical ocean modeling have not been further solved. Here, we present AI-GOMS, a large AI-driven global ocean modeling system, for accurate and efficient global ocean daily prediction. AI-GOMS consists of a backbone model with the Fourier-based Masked Autoencoder structure for basic ocean variable prediction and lightweight fine-tuning models incorporating regional downscaling, wave decoding, and biochemistry coupling modules. AI-GOMS has achieved the best performance in 30 days of prediction for the global ocean basic variables with 15 depth layers at 1/4{\\deg} spatial resolution. Beyond the good performance in statistical metrics, AI-GOMS realizes the simulation of mesoscale eddies in the Kuroshio region at 1/12{\\deg} spatial resolution and ocean stratification in the tropical Pacific Ocean. AI-GOMS provides a new backbone-downstream paradigm for Earth system modeling, which makes the system transferable, scalable and reusable.",

    "title": "Ecological Risk Assessment and Impact Factor Analysis of Ecological Spatial Patterns in Coastal Counties: Taking Dalian Pulandian District as an Example",
    "abstract": "A scientific foundation for the sustainable development of ecosystems and the improvement of the ecological spatial security pattern in the area is provided by carrying out a scientific assessment of ecological risk levels in coastal counties. An ecological risk assessment model was established in Pulandian district, Dalian, based on four periods of land use data from 1990 to 2020 combined with the PSR model. The spatial and temporal evolution of ecological risk in Pulandian was analyzed on this basis, and an exploratory regression analysis and a geographically weighted regression model were then used to explore the driving role of natural and social factors on comprehensive ecological risk in coastal counties. The findings demonstrate that there is an obvious ecological landscape type of conversion, with the majority of arable land being converted to forest land in northcentral and southwest areas, reflecting an improvement in the ecological environment and air quality, and the majority of coastal beach land being converted to construction land among the volumes transferred out and in. The area of high risk increased by 73.17% during the course of 30 years, with the majority of it concentrated in the research areas southern Fengrong, Tiexi, and Taiping regions in 1990 before expanding to the northeast, southeast, and central regions. The status index and response index both show a decline followed by an increase in change, while the pressure index shows a rising tendency with socioeconomic progress. The comprehensive ecological risk in the study area is significantly influenced by the urbanization rate, the ratio of environmental protection investment to GDP, the ecosystem service index, and the ecological space–land use ratio, with the urbanization rate displaying more overt negative correlation-driving characteristics, the ratio of environmental protection investment to GDP displaying significant spatial division characteristics, and the ecological space–land use ratio being an important factor. The findings serve as a foundation for decisions on ecological risk avoidance, control, and construction in Pulandian.",

    "title": "Study on the Variations in Water Storage in Lake Qinghai Based on Multi-Source Satellite Data",
    "abstract": "Performing research on the variation in lake water on the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (QTP) can give the area’s ecological environmental preservation a scientific foundation. In this paper, we first created a high-precision dataset of lake water level variation every 10 days, from July 2002 to December 2022, using multi-source altimetry satellite SGDR data (Envisat RA-2, SARAL, Jason-1/2, and Sentinel-3A/3B SRAL), which integrated the methods of atmospheric path delay correction, waveform re-tracking, outlier detection, position reduction using a height difference model, and inter-satellite deviation adjustment. Then, using Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper, Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper, and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager data, an averaged area series of Lake Qinghai (LQ) from September to November, each year from 2002 to 2019, was produced. The functional connection between the water level and the area was determined by fitting the water level–area series data, and the lake area time series, of LQ. Using the high-precision lake water level series, the fitted lake surface area time series, and the water storage variation equation, the water storage variation time series of LQ was thus calculated every 10 days, from July 2002 to December 2022. When the hydrological gauge data from the Xiashe station and data from the worldwide inland lake water level database are used as references, the standard deviations of the LQ water level time series are 0.0676 m and 0.1201 m, respectively. The results show that the water storage of LQ increases by 11.022 × 109 m3 from July 2002 to December 2022, with a growth rate of 5.3766 × 108 m3/a. The growth rate from January 2005 to January 2015 is 4.4850 × 108 m3/a, and from January 2015 to December 2022, the growth rate is 8.9206 × 108 m3/a. Therefore, the increased rate of water storage in LQ over the last 8 years has been substantially higher than in the previous 10 years.",

    "abstract": "With the escalating issues of resource waste and environmental pollution, the effective recycling of cardboard boxes within the logistics sector has emerged as a crucial factor in advancing sustainable development. This study employs the extended theory of planned behavior (ETPB) to devise a questionnaire and gather data from 700 respondents in China, aiming to analyze the influential factors that impact consumers’ engagement in recycling mechanisms provided by express delivery companies. Utilizing a principal component analysis, five co-factors that influence consumers’ willingness to recycle are identified. The findings of a multinomial logistic regression reveal a positive correlation between these five co-factors and recycling behavior, with attitude exhibiting the greatest significant influence (5.076 times in model 1 and 2.375 times in model 2) on recycling behavior. These results will serve as a scientific foundation for express delivery companies and governmental entities to adapt and optimize existing environmental protection policies, thus fostering sustainable development.",

    "title": "Spatiotemporal Dynamics and Influencing Factors of Vegetation Net Primary Productivity in the Yangtze River Delta Region, China",
    "abstract": "Vegetation Net Primary Productivity (NPP) plays a crucial role in terrestrial carbon sinks and the global carbon cycle. Investigating the spatiotemporal dynamics and influencing factors in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region can furnish a solid scientific foundation for green, low-carbon, and sustainable development in China, as well as a reference for other rapidly urbanizing regions. This study focuses on the YRD region as an illustration and utilizes the Carnegie–Ames–Stanford Approach (CASA model) to quantify NPP in this region from 2000 to 2018. Investigation into the spatiotemporal dynamics and influencing factors was conducted using Theil–Sen median trend analysis and scenario analysis. The results indicate that the NPP in the YRD region from 2000 to 2018 exhibited pronounced spatial differentiation characteristics, typically exhibiting a spatial distribution pattern of being high in the south and low in the north, high in the west and low in the east. Additionally, the expansion of built-up areas and the reduction in cultivated land have the potential to reduce NPP in the YRD region. Moreover, the influence of land-use and land-cover change (LULCC) is anticipated to be relatively limited compared to that of climate change. Furthermore, changes in precipitation were found to be positively correlated with changes in NPP, with the effect being relatively more pronounced. The correlation between temperature and NPP demonstrated spatial differentiation, with a mainly positive correlation in the central and southern parts of the YRD and a mainly negative correlation in the northern part. Changes in solar radiation had a negative correlation with changes in NPP. Based on these results, it is recommended that local governments strictly enforce urban development boundaries and manage the disorderly expansion of built-up areas, enhance the regional irrigation infrastructure, and address air pollution, so as to ensure the necessary conditions for the growth of vegetation, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and control regional temperature rises. This study can provide stronger evidence for revealing the influencing mechanisms of NPP through the control of impact conditions and the exclusion of confounding factors via scenario analysis. The policy implications can offer insights into NPP enhancement and environmental management for the YRD and other rapidly urbanizing regions.",

    "abstract": "The mechanical/thermal/electrical properties on-demand design of CNTs-reinforced nanocomposites is a key scientific issue that limits the development of new-generation smart nanomaterials, and the establishment of a corresponding unified theoretical prediction model for the mechanical/thermal/electrical properties is the foundation of nanocomposites. Based on the equivalent medium theory (EMT) obtained by Maxwell far-field matching, a unified mechanical/thermal/electrical modified EMT model is established by introducing Young’s modulus, thermal conductivity, and electrical conductivity to the thin filler–matrix’s interlayer. According to literature, the proposed model was employed to theoretically calculate the variations in the overall Young’s modulus, thermal conductivity, and electrical conductivity of CNTs-reinforced nanocomposites with respect to the volume concentration of CNT fillers. Then, the applicability of the proposed theoretical model was validated in comparison with the experimental measurements. Numerical calculations showed that the interface is a key factor affecting the mechanical/thermal/electrical properties of CNTs-reinforced nanocomposites, and strengthening the interfacial effect is an effective way to enhance the overall properties of nanocomposites. In addition, the aspect ratio of CNT fillers also significantly affects the material properties of the CNT fillers interface phase and the CNTs-reinforced nanocomposites. By fitting the experimental data, the calculation expressions of the aspect ratios of CNT fillers on the Young’s modulus, thermal conductivity, and electrical conductivity of the CNT fillers interfacial phase are quantitatively given, respectively.",

    "title": "A Detailed Examination of China’s Clean Energy Mineral Consumption: Footprints, Trends, and Drivers",
    "abstract": "As the global clean energy transition accelerates, China’s mining industry faces pressing challenges concerning the sustainable consumption of clean energy minerals. This study employed the EE-MRIO model to investigate the consumption trends of clean energy minerals across various provinces and industries in China from 2012 to 2017, specifically focusing on the resource footprints of copper, nickel, molybdenum, zinc, and cobalt. Using the random forest model, we identified the driving factors, with the goal of offering a solid scientific foundation for strategic decision making. Our findings reveal marked disparities in resource footprints among provinces, which are correlated with regional industrialization, urbanization trends, and resource reserves. Beyond the traditional resource-intensive sectors, industries like finance and real estate have significantly impacted the resource footprint. Monte Carlo simulations further validated the reliability of our model. The random forest analysis indicates that population size and energy consumption mainly determine the footprints of copper and zinc. In contrast, the footprints of nickel and cobalt are primarily influenced by technology market turnover, while molybdenum’s footprint is largely driven by population size and total carbon emissions. Drawing from these insights, we suggest several policy recommendations for clean energy mineral extraction. These include fostering inter-provincial resource collaboration, bolstering geological exploration and assessment, promoting technological innovation, advancing environmentally friendly mineral extraction techniques, and enhancing collaboration between urban planning and pivotal industries.",

    "title": "Optimization of sports effect evaluation technology from random forest algorithm and elastic network algorithm",
    "abstract": "This study leverages advanced data mining and machine learning techniques to delve deeper into the impact of sports activities on physical health and provide a scientific foundation for informed sports selection and health promotion. Guided by the Elastic Net algorithm, a sports performance assessment model is meticulously constructed. In contrast to the conventional Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso) algorithm, this model seeks to elucidate the factors influencing physical health indicators due to sports activities. Additionally, the incorporation of the Random Forest algorithm facilitates a comprehensive evaluation of sports performance across distinct dimensions: wrestling-type sports, soccer-type sports, skill-based sports, and school physical education. Employing the Top-K criterion for evaluation and juxtaposing it with the high-performance Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, the accuracy is scrutinized under three distinct criteria: Top-3, Top-5, and Top-10. The pivotal innovation of this study resides in the amalgamation of the Elastic Net and Random Forest algorithms, permitting a holistic contemplation of the influencing factors of diverse sports activities on physical health indicators. Through this integrated methodology, the research achieves a more precise assessment of the effects of sports activities, unveiling a range of impacts various sports have on physical health. Consequently, a more refined assessment tool for sports performance detection and health development is established. Capitalizing on the Elastic Net algorithm, this research optimizes model construction during the pivotal feature selection phase, effectively capturing the crucial influencing factors associated with different sports activities. Concurrently, the integration of the Random Forest algorithm augments the predictive prowess of the model, enabling the sports performance assessment model to comprehensively unveil the extent of impact stemming from various sports activities. This study stands as a noteworthy contribution to the arena of sports performance assessment, offering substantial insights and advancements to both sports health and research methodologies.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates how environmental regulations and social norms affect farmers’ chemical fertilizer reduction behaviors (CFRBs) and investigates the mediating role played by social norms and the moderating role played by social networks. As the analysis tool, a structural equation model is employed to analyze the data collected from a questionnaire survey with 402 valid samples of Chinese citrus growers. This study reveals that (1) environmental regulations and social norms have a significant effect on farmers’ CFRBs; (2) injunctive social norms are a partial mediator of the relationship between incentive-based environmental regulations and farmers’ CFRBs; (3) social networks play a positive moderating role in the relationship between injunctive social norms and farmers’ CFRBs; and (4) large-scale farmers’ CFRBs are more susceptible to the impact of environmental regulations and social norms than small-scale farmers. The result of this study provides a significant scientific foundation for the Chinese agricultural sector to develop policies to combat soil pollution in agriculture.",

    "title": "Towards a Methodology and Framework for AI Sustainability Metrics",
    "abstract": "Recently, we are witnessing truly groundbreaking achievements using AI models, such as the much talked about generative large language models, the broader area of foundation models, and the wide range of applications with a tremendous potential to accelerate scientific discovery, and enhance productivity. AI models and their use are growing at a super-linear pace. Inference jobs are measured by the trillions, and model parameters by the billions. This scaling up comes with a tremendous environmental cost, associated with every aspect of models' life cycle: data preparation, pre-training, and post deployment re-training, inference, and, the embodied emission of the systems used to support the execution. There is an urgent need for the community to come together and conduct a meaningful conversation about the environmental cost of AI. To do that, we ought to develop an agreed upon set of metrics, methodology, and framework to quantify AI's sustainability cost in a holistic and complete fashion. In this paper, we propose unified AI Sustainability metrics that can help foster a sustainability mind-set and enable analysis, and strategy setting. To do that, we build on and extend the data center sustainability metrics, defined in [19], by introducing (for the first time to our knowledge) the concept of embodied product emission (EPC) to capture the creation cost of software assets, such as software platforms, models, and data-sets. We then use this new concept to expand the job sustainability cost metrics (JCS and ASC) offered in [19] to factor in the context of the execution of jobs, such as a platform as-a-service, or a model serving inference jobs. The result is applicable to any data center job, not just for AI, and contributes towards accuracy and completeness. We then show how to apply this approach to AI, with a particular focus on the entire life cycle, including all phases of the life cycle, as well as the provenance of models, where one model is used (distilled) to create another one. We demonstrate how the metric can be used to inform a more meaningful debate about AI strategies and cost. Te novelty of the approach is that it can be used to reason about strategies and trade-offs across the life cycle and 'supply-chain' of models.",

    "title": "Current Trends in Language for Specific Purposes Research and Their Relevance to Arabic for Specific Purposes (ASP): A Systematic Literature Review",
    "abstract": "The article aims to shed light on the burgeoning trends of Language for Specific Purposes (LSP) on a global scale and their relevance to Arabic for Specific Purposes (ASP). These trends encompass evolving orientations, novel curriculum developments, and pertinent principles guiding their growth. This contribution addresses the theoretical foundation gap evident in the dearth of Arabic for Specific Purposes (ASP) research on an international level. This study used a systematic literature review (SLR) method to adhere to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol model, with the primary data sources comprising reputable scientific journal articles from the Scopus database. Based on 47 articles, the review reveals that the orientation trends span various domains, including academic, business, medicine, nursing, communication, tourism, politics, professional, religious, and technology. The academic orientation holds the highest percentage at 62%. It also shows a significant disparity between English and Arabic in LSP research trends, with English dominating at 96% compared to a mere 4% for Arabic. Notably, ASP curriculum development is characterised by a diverse array of approaches. Researchers have increasingly integrated other frameworks such as Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL), Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR), Relevance, Integration, Culture, and Holism (RICH), and Artificial Intelligence (AI). This nuanced approach ensures a comprehensive development of ASP while acknowledging the linguistic richness inherent in Arabic. ",

    "title": "Spatial Characteristics and Obstacle Factors of Cultivated Land Quality in an Intensive Agricultural Region of the North China Plain",
    "abstract": "Cultivated land quality (CLQ) is at the core of the trinity protection of cultivated land in China. Scientific evaluation of CLQ and identification of its obstacle factors are the foundation for the construction and improvement of the quality of cultivated land. The main objective of this study was to evaluate CLQ and identify its obstacle factors, and Quzhou County, an intensive agricultural region in the North China Plain (NCP), was selected as a case study. The evaluation index system of CLQ was constructed based on five dimensions, including climate condition, topographic characteristic, soil property, farming status, and environmental condition, by analyzing the logical evolution of elements, processes, functions, and quality of cultivated land. A methodological system based on the Weighted Summation Method (WSM) and the “1 + X” model was developed to evaluate the CLQ. Then, the obstacle diagnosis model constructed based on the Cask Law and relevant academic studies was used to identify the obstacle factors of CLQ. The results showed that the proportion of high-, medium-, and low-quality cultivated land in Quzhou County was 36.19%, 33.60%, and 30.21%, respectively, and the average grade of CLQ was 2.97, which was considered to be at a medium level. Moran’s I of global spatial autocorrelation in Quzhou County was 0.8782, indicating a significant positive autocorrelation of the cultivated land quality index (CLQI). The main obstacle factors of CLQ in Quzhou County were soil profile constitution, irrigation guarantee rate, groundwater depth, and soil microbial biomass carbon. Therefore, based on the stable and dynamic characteristics of the obstacle factors, suggestions were provided to improve the quality of cultivated land in terms of strengthening the consolidation of cultivated land, transforming the concept of agricultural fertilization, and carrying out cultivated land recuperation. This study provides a new perspective on the cognition, evaluation, and identification of obstacle factors of CLQ, and the findings of this study can provide a reference for the consolidation and improvement of CLQ in the NCP.",

    "abstract": "Using findings from an inductive study of two high‐hazard organizations and insights from behavioral ethics literature, we build a model illustrating the behavioral foundations of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). We show that employees in high‐hazard organizations scrutinize their work, actively deciding how to alter work tasks and boundaries and persevering through obstacles to lay the groundwork for CSR. Central to this process is employee moral awareness—the awareness of one's activities and the consequences those activities may have on others—through which they translate organizational hazards into their work decisions. Our findings further suggest that moral awareness is more dynamic than previously conceptualized, continually assembled, and reassembled through the active exchange and deployment of scientific and moral principles. In contrast to the extant literature that prioritizes the unitary nature of CSR and its top‐down effects, our findings uncover individual‐level ethical decisions as its foundation and identify moral awareness and work scrutinization as mechanisms through which individuals lay the groundwork for CSR.",

    "title": "Low-Dose Aspirin after ASPRE—More Questions Than Answers? Current International Approach after PE Screening in the First Trimester",
    "abstract": "Preeclampsia (PE) is a multi-factorial disorder of pregnancy, and it continues to be one of the leading causes of fetal and maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Aspirin is universally recommended for high-risk women to reduce preeclampsia risk. The purpose of this review is to summarize the recommendations of various scientific societies on predicting preeclampsia and their indications for the inclusion of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) prophylaxis. Fourteen guidelines were compared. The recommended dose, screening method, and gestational age at the start of the test vary depending on the recommendation. The societies are inclined to recommend using increasingly higher doses (>75 mg) of ASA, with many encouraging doses from 100 mg upward. Most societies indicate that the optimal time for implementing aspirin is prior to 16 weeks’ gestation. Following the publication of the Aspirin for Evidence-Based Preeclampsia Prevention (ASPRE) trial results and other papers evaluating the Fetal Medicine Foundation (FMF) screening model, a large number of societies have changed their recommendations from those based on risk factors alone to the ones based on the risk assessment proposed by the FMF. This allows for the detection of a high-risk pregnancy population in whom aspirin will be remarkably effective in preventing preterm PE, thereby decreasing maternal and fetal morbidity.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: This article aims to describe the idea of designing learning video products related to the material \"Knowing Pulse, Tempo, and Note Values in Music\" The aim being pursued is to bridge teachers in carrying out the process of learning arts and culture (music), the material being concentrated is related to the time element (rhythm). Rhythm, which contains pulses, tempos and note values, is seen as the essential foundation where the orientation will later be related to music learning, both from a scientific and practical point of view. So the urgency of the media that is carried out considers aspects that support the effectiveness of learning. Method: In this writing, the research model used is Research and Development (R&D) with the 4D approach, which Thiagarajan pioneered. Product development has been in the 2D (Design) stage. Where the media offered is based on research results or observations at the primary level in music learning, then media development is based on selecting the type of media to be developed. Considering the internet access that can be reached from anywhere and anytime, the authors chose learning videos as a product so that later they can be disseminated to teachers who will carry out rhythm-related learning. Result and Discussion: The learning video requires sound, image and movement components to be combined simultaneously to bridge the basic foundation in recognizing time elements in music; the speed chosen is at a tempo of 60 Bpm.",

The chief scientific objective is to introduce an information algorithm, specifically designed for the management of financial intelligence, to fortify the economic security framework. The focal point of the research is the information support system pertaining to financial intelligence management. The research methodology is anchored in the application of contemporary information modeling methods, supplemented by functional algorithmization of processes. A modern graphic method is employed to enhance comprehensibility and accessibility. As an outcome of the study, a model of an information algorithm is presented, tailored to manage financial intelligence within the economic security system. However, the study acknowledges its limitations and does not incorporate all the elements of economic security assurance. Future research is recommended to delve into the specifics of information security within the financial intelligence management system. A distinct advantage of the proposed information algorithm lies in its graphic representation, enhancing the accessibility of the financial intelligence management system. The research scope is regional, indicating a limitation in the study. Future work should aim to expand the geographic applicability of these findings, enhancing the generalizability and relevance of the study.",

    "abstract": "Deep-seated mineralization prediction is an important scientific problem in the area of mineral resources exploration. The 3D metallogenic information extraction of geology and geochemistry can be of great help. This study uses 3D modeling technology to intuitively depict the spatial distribution of orebodies, fractures, and intrusive rocks. In particular, the geochemical models of 12 elements are established for geochemical metallogenic information extraction. Subsequently, the front halo element association of As-Sb-Hg, the near-ore halo element association of Au-Ag-Cu-Pb-Zn, and the tail halo element association of W-Mo-Bi are identified. Upon this foundation, the 3D convolutional neural network model is built and used for deep-seated mineralization prediction, which expresses a high performance (AUC = 0.99). Associated with the metallogenic regularity, two mineral exploration targets are delineated, which might be able to serve as beneficial achievements for deep exploration in the Zaozigou gold deposit.",

It has widespread application in the (Linked) Open Data and scientific communities. However, DCAT does not specify a robust mechanism to create and maintain persistent identifiers for the datasets. It relies on Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs), that are not necessarily unique, resolvable and persistent. This impedes findability, citation abilities, and traceability of derived and aggregated data artifacts. As a remedy, we propose a decentralized identifier registry where persistent identifiers are managed by a set of collaborative distributed nodes. Every node gives full access to all identifiers, since an unambiguous state is shared across all nodes. This facilitates a common view on the identifiers without the need for a (virtually) centralized directory. To support this architecture, we propose a data model and network methodology based on a distributed ledger and the W3C recommendation for Decentralized Identifiers (DID). We implemented our approach as a working prototype on a five-peer test network based on Hyperledger Fabric.",

    "title": "A Review of Coastal Protection Using Artificial and Natural Countermeasures—Mangrove Vegetation and Polymers",
    "abstract": "Any stretch of coastline requires protection when the rate of erosion exceeds a certain threshold and seasonal coastal drift fluctuations fail to restore balance. Coast erosion can be caused by natural, synthetic, or a combination of the two. Severe storm occurrences, onshore interventions liable for sedimentation, wave action on the coastlines, and rising sea levels caused by climate change are instances of natural factors. The protective methods used to counteract or prevent coastal flooding are categorized as hard and soft engineering techniques. This review paper is based on extensive reviews and analyses of scientific publications. In order to establish a foundation for the selection of appropriate adaptation measures for coastal protection, this research compiles literature on a combination of both natural and artificial models using mangrove trees and polymer-based models’ configurations and their efficiency in coastal flooding. Mangrove roots occur naturally and cannot be manipulated unlike artificial model configuration which can be structurally configured with different hydrodynamic properties. Artificial models may lack the real structural features and hydrodynamic resistance of the mangrove root it depicts, and this can reduce its real-life application and accuracy. Further research is required on the integration of hybrid configuration to fully optimize the functionality of mangrove trees for coastal protection.",

    "title": "The Impact of Green Innovation Capacity on Urban Economic Resilience: Evidence from China’s Yangtze River Delta Region",
    "abstract": "Urban green innovation plays a crucial role in achieving sustainable urban economic development, and urban economic resilience is an important manifestation of urban economic development. This prese nt study aims to investigate how green innovation contributes to urban economies’ resilience, which is essential for long-term urban agglomeration expansion and sustainable economic development. To decrease subjectivity and achieve comprehensive evaluation, this study first constructs an index system for evaluating green innovation capability on urban economic resilience, which contains 21 indicators in three areas, including innovation input, innovation output, and green innovation foundation, and the performs a scientific evaluation using the TOPSIS method. On this basis, using the Super-SBM model, the green innovation efficiency value of cities in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) is calculated. Finally, ArcGIS 10.8 software is used to classify the economic resilience of the 26 cities in the YRD city cluster and analyze the spatial layout characteristics of urban economic resilience. The results show that: (1) the decision evaluation model used in this study is stable and effective, and it can effectively address the issues of subjective assessment processes and information redundancy; (2) green innovation capacity has a positive contribution to urban economic resilience, and its contribution is more significant for cities with strong economic strength; and (3) the green innovation capacity of the YRD city cluster is unevenly distributed, with Shanghai, Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Nanjing having high levels of green innovation capacity and strong urban economic resilience, thus forming the core area of cities radiating outward, showing a “core-edge” spatially. Finally, suggestions for improving the overall economic resilience of urban agglomerations are provided.",

The study of the network system of technology transfer in Ukraine is an important problem of innovative development and commercialization of innovative developments. The formation of an effective network system of technology transfer is the foundation of innovative development of Ukraine's economy, which is key to determining Ukraine's place in global innovative development.\nGoal. Determination of the theoretical and methodological basis of the formation of a model of the network system of technology transfer in Ukraine\nMethod (methodology). The methodological basis of the research is a system of general scientific and special methods, namely deduction (in the construction of the structure of the work in a logical relationship and study of the subject in general, the unity and interdependence of its components), induction (in the formation of general conclusions of the conducted research), abstract science and synthesis (in clarification of interpretations of categorical tools).\nThe results. Based on the results of the research, the concepts of technology transfer center and technology transfer network are summarized, the role of the technology transfer network in the innovative development of Ukraine is determined, and a structural and logical scheme of the model of the network system of technology transfer for Ukraine is proposed. It was determined that the main tasks of the technology transfer network are activities aimed at commercializing the results of scientific research and development, promoting cooperation and cooperation between science and industry, as well as providing services and consulting to companies in certain scientific fields. The network system of technology transfer acts as a transferable mechanism for the development, implementation of innovations and their introduction into life.\nThe formation of technology transfer centers on the basis of large research universities and scientific institutions creates a very powerful mechanism that carries out scientific, innovative, educational, and marketing activities. In this way, a multi-component structure is formed, which combines all processes related to the commercialization of innovations, knowledge and technologies.",

    "abstract": "For centuries, echinoderms, a marine-invertebrate phylum, have fascinated scientists for their developmental and postembryonic phenomen. Experimentation on their eggs and embryos in particular have contributed foundation scientific advances. However, powerful molecular genetic studies are restricted to embryonic developmental stages which are amenable to genetic perturbation by microinjection of reagents into the zygotes. This represents a significant bottleneck to the study of postembryonic processes in where the earliest function of a gene must remain intact. We therefore sought to establish a spatio-temporal turnable gene editing tool for these species. Here, using the sea star Patiria miniata as a model we introduce a chemically inducible, Tet-ON, gene expression system. Pairing this Tet-ON system with CRISPR-mediated gene alteration technology we show as a proof-of-principle demonstration an inducible gene editing in the sea star transgenic cell populations for the first time in echinoderm biology. The approach we show here can be adapted for use in other species of echinoderms and will also extend experimental possibilities tremendously.",

    "title": "A Study of College English Writing Teaching Based on Dynamic Assessment",
    "abstract": "For a long time, college-level English writing teaching in China has relied mainly on summative tests, which provide a single and rigid evaluation criteria and limit students' all-around development of writing ability. However, with the current reform of college English teaching, the single assessment method cannot cater to the changing needs of the new teaching model, which emphasizes the cultivation of students' ability to use language. To address this issue, this paper proposes introducing the notion of dynamic assessment into English writing classes at the college level. Dynamic assessment emphasizes the assessment of the learning process and feedback of teaching information, which can lead to a comprehensive, scientific, and reasonable assessment system that plays a crucial role in realizing teaching objectives. Based on Vygotsky's sociocultural theory of mind, this paper presents scaffolding strategies for each stage of writing in college English writing teaching and learning. These strategies serve as a foundation for constructing a theoretical dynamic assessment model in Chinese non-English majors' writing classes. By introducing dynamic assessment into college English writing teaching, this paper aims to explore new methods that increase the efficiency of college English writing teaching and promote college students' English writing ability to adapt to the reform of new requirements for college English teaching.",

    "title": "Ontological modeling of the psychological field of a play",
    "abstract": "The problems of checking and experimental verification for new knowledge remain relevant since foundation and development of scientific psychology. Historical evidence of this is the long and permanent methodological disagreements between the leading psychological branches (such as behaviorism, psychoanalysis, gestalt psychology, psychosynthesis, activity psychology, cognitive psychology, psychophysiology, coaching) and most other psychological branches. The absence of a methodological architectonics universal for psychology, an optimal design of checking and experimental verification for new scientific knowledge causes deserved criticism and comments on the objectivity of psychological research. The problems of checking and verifying new psychological knowledge are primarily associated with the dominance of the laboratory-experimental method in science; presumption of a causal model of scientific rationality; neglect of the possibilities of the intelligible multidisciplinary mode for scientific objectivism; perceived as secondary potentials and advantages of postnonclassical scientific rationality as well as factors of volatility of changes in social experience, features of the post-industrial (information) society and postmodern reality. The expressive features of the psychological research for actual objects of scientific knowledge are related to the fact that the most complex objects are phenomena that in the scientific sense are of fundamental importance as cultural universals, objects of the intelligible reality of eternal entities (Aristotle, Averoes (Ibn Rushd), I. Kant, J.-F. Herbart , E. Husserl, etc.). For example: communication, labor, socialization, intersubjectiveness, power, emergentness, creativity, collective knowledge, love, civilization, game, synchrony, moral act, disposition, social value, group reflection, collective unconscious, command spirit, attractiveness, trust, discourse, narrative and other. Also, these objects have an important region-generative value (E. Huserl), expressive epistemological (M. Foucault), cultural-historical (L. Vygotsky) and diachronic (F. de Saussure) aspects of scientific knowledge. The gnoseological content and volume, other features of cultural universals, similar to the games phenomenon, objectively complicate the content and choice of scientific research criteria, the standards for the representativeness of the empirical sample, the content, order and protocols of valid data correlation. Under such conditions, the presumption and dominance of the classical naturalistic experimental method (natural or laboratory experiment) is a untrustworthy and conditionally reliable methodological basis. The presented objective problems of modern systems of empirical verification for the results of psychological research, in particular, the problems of the game, require the search for more reliable foundations for the methodological program of verification for scientific knowledge. Important aspects of such a search are also the need to take into account the characteristics of the post-industrial (information) society and postmodern reality in psychological cognition, to use the advantages of postnonclassical scientific rationality. The important scientific contribution is the universality of such a program in relation to promising psychological research, as well as, if necessary, to the revision of existing scientific knowledge. The implementation of such tasks (on the example of the reconstruction for the games psychological field) makes it possible to use the status and role of a psychological tool for a methodological facility, which is ontological designing (the names “formal ontologization” and “ontological engineering” are used synonymously). In the circumstances of psychological research, ontological designing is a specially organized intelligible descriptive method for experimental verification of the results of psychological research. The product of applying the methodology of ontological designing in the circumstances of the games psychological research is the formation of an epistemological intelligible substrate – a descriptive cognitive field of the scientific object “game” with a verification function for this field. Because of the formation for a games psychological research on the basis of ontological designing and the universal norms of the categorical matrix for modern socio-humanitarian theory (the levels of “concrete”, “single”, “special”, “general” and “universal”), epistemic, hermeneutic heredity of psychological knowledge, rational empiricism is also possible. In the framework of the our research, ontological designing is: a) the psychological method of descriptive reconstruction of scientific knowledge; b) a facility of verifying the results of a psychological research for the scientific object “game”; c) a productive program for completing the games psychological research as a universal, a fundamental polyphenomenon that has a distinct non-spatial and timeless socio-psychological genesis, a complex structure and functionalism; d) the thinking style of a modern scientist for a socio-humanitarian profile in the circumstances of fleeting changes in empirical material; e) a facility for creating an architectonic intelligible model-matrix of a cognitively full-weighted, harmoniously structured, optimally exhaustive, logically balanced, hermeneutical coherent, epistemically relevant, constructively understandable games psychological field. The scientific basis for the methodological modernization of the norms for verifying the results of the games psychological research based on ontological designing is the approaches that implement the program of philosophical apriorism and logicism, the methodological positions of analytical philosophy, postnonclassical-oriented principles, approaches, facilities, tools and standards of psychological knowledge. The ontological model of the games psychological field includes five levels for scientific empirical conceptualization: 1) the level of the concrete, one-time empirical natural science fact of the hic et nunc game (a naturalistic empirical fact established “here and now” through the latest, fresh natural or laboratory experiment); 2) the level of the single, separate games manifestations in its epistemic, cultural-historical empiricism (the experience of empirical facts “here and now” – experiment, the results of past naturalistic facts available to the researcher); 3) the level of the distinctive, special explications of the games invariants, depending on the different ontogenetic conditions of such a manifestation (age dependencies; features of human development, stages of his socialization, social and professional self-realization, etc.); 4) the level of the general, common attributes and modes of the games explications, present in each fact of the entire play-based empiricism of the current and previous cultural-historical range accessible to the researcher; 5) the level of the universal – the level of attributes of the games phenomenon, which do not depend on existential, primarily chronological, spatial, situational prerequisites and are inherent in any, even imaginary, simulated, probable the games manifestation. Such foundations make it possible to synchronize the diachronic and synchronous aspects of the historical-rational process of the scientific knowledge for the game in a general research program. The formalized structural composition and regularities of construction of the ontological model of the subject games area is based on an established set of entities connected by various relationships (thesaurus, term/concept, attribute of a concept, relation of concepts, class/set of terms/concepts, axioms/rules/constraints of concepts and their relations, instance, etc.). On the range of research conceptualization, according to the levels of the categorical matrix, such an designing order is optimally suitable for creating an architectonic intelligible model-matrix of the psychological field of the Game.",

    "title": "Predicting the Environmental Change of Carbon Emission Patterns in South Asia: A Deep Learning Approach Using BiLSTM",
    "abstract": "China’s economy has made significant strides in the past three decades. As a direct result of China’s “one belt, one road” (OBOR) initiative, the country’s rate of industrialization and urbanization is currently the fastest in the entire world. This rapid development is largely dependent on the enormous amounts of energy currently being consumed and forms the foundation of the world’s high levels of carbon emissions. It is generally agreed that the production of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide, is the primary contributor to the current state of climate change. In this paper, a CO2 emission prediction model based on Bi-LSTM is constructed. In order to conduct empirical tests on the model, this study uses data from South Asian countries and China from 2001 to 2020. China’s CO2 emissions from 2022 to 2030 were predicted along with those of other countries in order to study the combined effects of the scientific and technological progress, industrial structures, and energy structure factors affecting CO2 emissions. When compared with the LSTM and GRU methods, the Bi-LSTM model’s results produced lower MAE, MSE, and MAPE values, indicating that it performs better. According to the findings, carbon emissions represent a significant problem that will become much worse in the future due to China and India’s high emissions, particularly in the next 10 years, if the government does not implement policies that help reduce those emissions.",

    "title": "Capacity Building of Displaced Universities: Strategies for Recovery and Development",
    "abstract": "Universities displaced by the war in Ukraine are addressing both the immediate challenges of resuming their full-fledged educational and research activities and laying the foundation for their own development models. The experience of relocation and recovery gained by displaced universities is important for understanding their sustainability potential and for developing public policy and further strategies for the development of higher education in Ukraine. Researchers pay much attention to the impact of the war on higher education in Ukraine, the problems of organizing the activities of displaced universities, their restoration and strategic development. Today, displaced universities continue to build their own new model of development. Modern challenges have necessitated the search for new opportunities to overcome the crisis in society, to study the role and place of universities in regional development and the post-war economic recovery of Ukraine. Today, there are scientific and practical publications that summarise the current issues of the functioning and development of higher education in general and displaced HEIs in particular. However, the existing cases and practices require more thorough research and generalisation, which would be useful for both theorists and practitioners of higher education management. Such research should focus on the formation of signs of sustainability, adaptability, self-organisation and development of the higher education system in times of crisis. The purpose of the publication is to highlight the problems and challenges faced by the displaced universities, to assess the experience and achievements in responding to these challenges, and to describe the approaches taken to update and implement the university development strategy and anti-crisis measures during the relocation. The publication also attempts to outline the main solutions that are already being implemented, tasks and activities for the future, which are being developed by the community of displaced universities to restore the university's activities and its transition to a qualitatively new level already during the relocation and in the postwar period. In addition, the publication aims to highlight the experience of organizing cooperation between displaced universities in implementing international projects to restore their activities.",

    "abstract": "The scientific use of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) to improve the production capacity of saline–alkali soil is critical to achieve green agriculture and sustainable land use. It serves as a foundation for the scientific use of CMC to clarify the water and salt transport characteristics of CMC-treated soil. In this study, a one-dimensional soil column infiltration experiment was carried out to investigate the effects of different CMC dosages (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 g/kg) on the infiltration characteristics, infiltration model parameters, water and salt distribution, and salt leaching of saline–alkali soil in Xinjiang, China. The results showed that the final cumulative infiltration of CMC-treated soil increased by 8.63–20.72%, and the infiltration time to reach the preset wetting front depth increased by 1.02–3.96 times. The sorptivity (S) in the Philip infiltration model and comprehensive shape coefficient (α) in the algebraic infiltration model showed a trend of increasing first and then decreasing with CMC dosage, revealing a quadratic polynomial relationship. The algebraic model could accurately simulate the water content profile of CMC-treated soil. CMC enhanced the soil water holding capacity and salt leaching efficiency. The average soil water content, desalination rate, and leaching efficiency were increased by 5.18–15.54%, 21.17–57.15%, and 11.61–30.18%, respectively. The effect of water retention and salt inhibition on loamy sand was the best when the CMC dosage was 0.6 g/ kg. In conclusion, the results provide a theoretical basis for the rational application of CMC to improve saline–alkali soil in arid areas.",

    "title": "EXOGENOUS AND ENDOGENOUS FACTORS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF TERRITORIAL COMMUNITIES: A MARKETING APPROACH TO DEFINITION",
    "abstract": "The article argues that the frequent use of the term \"local development\" in scientific literature provides an overly broad foundation for its interpretations. Furthermore, measuring the rates and directions of local development can be expressed through economic, social, demographic, and other indicators. Additionally, it can be described by qualitative parameters, incorporating both subjective and objective data. Therefore, defining the content of the concept, its territorial dimension, or measurement method is challenging. It is determined that the concept of local development should not be perceived solely as a subjectively constructed notion of a functioning development mechanism. On the contrary, it normatively represents assumptions regarding the desired model of local development, thus serving as a program according to which the characterized mechanism can be modified. Given the binary nature of the determinants of local development, influenced by external and internal factors, all theories describing it are classified into exogenous and endogenous. Similarly, an approach to interpreting the concept of local development as a unique combination of internal and external influences is formulated. In this context, components of the development process within the scope of local self-government competence include strategic and operational planning, coordination of efforts in implementing planned local development projects, direct financing or indirect financial support for local entrepreneurial initiatives, marketing of their activities, spatial planning, and more. Based on a comparative analysis of theoretical studies in the field of local development, the conclusion is drawn that, according to the postulates of local development, the processes of economic transformation in territorial communities should be directed towards diversifying their economic bases. This implies promoting the development of economic activities not directly tied to their natural resources. Shifting this focus will help alleviate the consequences of rising unemployment in peripheral regions and lay the groundwork for their long-term development.",

    "title": "DETERMINATION OF THE IMPACT ZONE OF ENABLING WORKS OF A NEW CONSTRUCTION ON THE SURROUNDING BUILDINGS",
    "abstract": "For modern urban construction in the compacted conditions of new sites, the question of the stability of soil massifs under existing buildings is relevant. The intensity of development of possible deformations largely depends on the mutual location of the base of the previously erected foundation and the pit for the new building. The article provides a methodology for determining the area of influence of the pit on the soil foundations of adjacent buildings, depending on the type of enclosing structures and the depth of the pit used. The impact zone was calculated for the pit using protective structures in the form of Larsen sheet piles, bored piles and a diaphragm wall. Corresponding zones of influence of a pit excavated to different depths using different types of pit construction are graphically determined. The scientific result can be explained by the fact that the idealized model of the influence zone takes into account the conditions under which the boundary of the influence zone of a new building can be limited to a distance at which the calculated value of additional subsidence of the soil massif or the base of the existing structure of the surrounding building does not exceed 1 mm. The dimensions of the influence zones are determined at different pit depths, which roughly correspond to the location of the one-, two-, and three-level underground structures of the building. Increasing the depth of the pit to two underground floors increases the zone of influence by 24-31% for the considered types of pit enclosure, and up to three floors - by 14-17%. It was established that the nature of the change in the zone of influence is similar for different types of enclosure structures, and the transition from rigid to flexible functioning of the pit enclosure depends on the ratio of the enclosure's rigidity and the excavation depth. As a practical result of the research, it can be used when choosing the type of construction of the pit to prevent the negative impact of the construction works of the new construction on the surrounding buildings.

    "abstract": "Problem statement. In the construction of multi-storey and high-rise buildings with significant loads on the foundation, especially in the presence of weak water-saturated soils from above, pile and slab foundations are usually used to meet the requirements of the building code [1] on the maximum permissible deformations. The possibility of using slab foundations in this case must be confirmed by calculations with a scientific and technical justification of the accepted model of the soil foundation and its parameters. The purpose of the article is to substantiate the application of the model of the soil base in the form of finite width elastic layer and its parameters based on observations of the subsidence of adjacent multi-story buildings on slab foundations during the construction process and to compare the actual values of foundation deformations with calculated. Conclusions. The research results confirmed the possibility of applying the model of the soil base in the form of finite width elastic layer for predicting the deformations of equally story sectional buildings on large-sized slab foundations, the basis of which are weak water-saturated sandy soils from the surface. However, it should be noted that in this case, the excess of the actual settlement of buildings over the estimated is due to the failure to take into acount the processes of filtration consolidation and mechanical suffusion of sand particles into the crushed stone bed, which can further be taken into acount by reducing of soil deformation modules in this model of the soil base.",

The aim of the research is to analyze the evolution of the theoretical and modeling foundation of the physical picture of the world with the identification of promising research vectors that have the potential to form broad generalized models of the Universe, in other words, the theory of Everything.\n\nMethodology. To achieve this goal, methods of systematization and generalization, meta-analysis, and meta-synthesis were employed. Since this study is a review and is intended to systematize and deepen knowledge, its structure is unconventional.\n\nResults. The current model of the scientific landscape is described, based on which the dynamic vectors of development of the theoretical foundation of the Universe theory were determined. This allowed us to conclude the current state of the system of physical modeling as the main tool for the civilizational development of mankind. The research suggests that at the current stage of development of ideas about the physical picture of the world, M-theory is a potential model of the theory of Everything.\n\nConclusions. The practical significance of the research results indicates a potential mathematical and theoretical concept (among existing theories and models) that is relevant and adequate to modern ideas about cosmogony, phenomena, and the structure of the Universe. This can attract more attention to a certain direction of scientific research, not only among the professional community but also among the general public",

    "abstract": "After the construction of the Keban Dam, some settlements with historical, cultural, and natural value were flooded. A scientific committee consisting of academicians and public authorities decided to the relocation of the buildings including the historical Çelebiağa Mosque. In this study, the seismic soil-structure interaction analysis of the historical Çelebiağa Mosque, which was dismantled and reconstructed in a separate region due to the construction of the Keban Dam was carried out. The analysis of the masonry mosque was performed with the SAP2000 finite element analysis software. The Winkler foundation model was used to idealize the soil environment on which the historical mosque was built. The effects of soil-structure interaction on historical masonry mosque were examined in terms of transmitted acceleration, response spectra, and lateral displacement at various heights of the structure. Depending on the results of the analysis, the effects of soil-structure interaction of a reconstructed historical masonry building were investigated. PGA was obtained as 0.51g at the flag level of the minaret under the Kocaeli earthquake and 0.94g under the Sivrice earthquake. Again, the maximum horizontal displacements of the minaret at the flag level were obtained as 11 cm and 8.5 cm under the Kocaeli and Sivrice earthquakes. The behavior of historical masonry structures under earthquake loads has been interpreted by considering the geological conditions.",

The results show that the erosion of the Hau river in An Giang province during the period 2010–2019 has steadily and widely occurred both in seasons. There is a significant difference in the Hau river’s bank changing compared with the popular one in the past. The riverbank erosion process has occurred increasingly, with solid intensity, in a complex way, and even more in the dry season. It is identified that the causes of the erosion are from hydrological characteristics, river flow dynamics, the geological structure, soil characteristics, and the form of the riverbed and economic - social activities. The finding is a scientific foundation to resolve the riverbank stabilization.",

    "title": "Mapping Spatiotemporal Changes in Forest Type and Aboveground Biomass from Landsat Long-Term Time-Series Analysis - A Case Study from Yaoluoping National Nature Reserve, Anhui Province of Eastern China",
    "abstract": "A natural reserve’s forest is an important base for promoting natural education, scientific research, biodiversity conservation and carbon accounting. Dynamic monitoring of the forest type and forest aboveground biomass (AGB) in a nature reserve is an important foundation for assessing the forest succession stage and trend. Based on the Landsat images covering the National Nature Reserve of Yaoluoping in Anhui province spanning from 1987 to 2020, a total of 42 Landsat scenes, the forest cover product set was first developed by using the well-established vegetation change tracker (VCT) model. On this basis, a new vegetation index, NDVI_DR, which considers the phenological characteristics of different forest types, was proposed to distinguish coniferous forest from broad-leaved forest. Next, multiple modeling factors, including remote sensing spectral signatures, vegetation indices, textural measures derived from gray level co-occurrence matrix and wavelet analysis and topographic attributes, were compiled to model the AGB in 2011 by forest type separately by using the stochastic gradient boosting (SGB) algorithm. Then, using the 2011 Landsat image as the base, all the Landsat images in the other years involved in the modelling were relatively normalized by using the weighted invariant pixels (WIP) method, followed by an extrapolation of the 2011 AGB model to other years to create a time-series of AGB. The results showed that the overall accuracy of the VCT-based forest classification products was over 90%. The annual forest type classifications derived from NDVI_DR thresholding gained an overall accuracy above 92%, with a kappa coefficient above 0.8. The 2011 forest-type-dependent SGB-based AGB estimation model achieved an independent validation R2 at 0.63 and an RMSE at 11.18 t/ha for broad-leaved forest, and 0.61 and 14.26 t/ha for coniferous forest. The mapped time-series of AGB showed a gradual increasing trend over the past three decades. The driving factors responsible for the observed forest cover and AGB changes were analyzed to provide references for reasonable protection and development. The proposed methodology is a reliable tool for evaluating the management status, which can be extended to other similar regions.",

    "abstract": "The new development concept is the theoretical guidance and important foundation for high-quality foreign trade development in the new era. This paper develops an evaluation index system to measure the high-quality development level of foreign trade based on the meaning of high-quality development of foreign trade under the new concept of development. The dynamic changing trend of high-quality development of China's provincial foreign trade from 2013 to 2019 and the ranking change of the development index are examined in this paper using a time series factor model. Finally, China's provinces are categorized based on the quality of their foreign trade development. The findings show that, from 2013 to 2019, China's high-quality foreign trade development has been on the rise; the level of high-quality foreign trade development has been raised to varying degrees in the eastern, central, and western regions of China, but each region plays a different role. Compared to 2013, the truly “high-quality” areas of China’s provincial foreign trade development were always concentrated in the eastern region, which ranked high on the comprehensive evaluation index, while the “low-quality” areas were mainly concentrated in the central and western regions, which ranked low on the comprehensive evaluation index.",

    "abstract": "The financial status of an enterprise is related to its healthy and long-term development, and whether the interests of investors and bank loans can be guaranteed. To improve the prediction accuracy of corporate financial risk, this paper proposes a prediction model for corporate financial risk that integrates GRA-TOPSIS and SMOTE-CNN. First, using GRA-TOPSIS to make a comprehensive evaluation of the financial situation of listed companies. Second, the evaluation results are clustered to obtain the scientific level and interval of financial risk, which lays the foundation for the supervised learning of the convolutional neural network. Then, the SMOTE algorithm is introduced to solve the problem of data imbalance of enterprises at all levels, and the focal loss function is used instead of the cross-entropy loss function to further balance the data. Finally, the listed companies in A shares are randomly selected, and experiments were designed to verify the performance of the model built in this paper. The results show that the prediction accuracy of the financial risk prediction model based on GRA-TOPSIS and SMOTE-CNN is 98.57%, which indicates that the model is feasible and has certain reference value.",

    "title": "Applying Machine Learning Approach to Start-up Success Prediction",
    "abstract": "Predicting the success of a new venture has always been a topical issue for both investors and researchers. Nowadays, it has become even more relevant concerning start-ups-young innovative and technology enterprises aimed at scaling their businesses. The purpose of this study is to create a model for predicting start-ups’ success based on their descriptive characteristics. A model that connects such start-up features as the period from foundation to the first financing, the area of activity, type, and amount of the first financing round, business model, and applied technologies, with the start-up investment success, which refers to re-investment, has been developed using data from the Dealroom platform on statistics of start-ups activity and their description. The final sample included 123 start-ups that are founded or operate in Ukraine. Three machine learning algorithms are compared: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. Acceptable results were obtained in terms of Accuracy, Sensitivity, and F-score, despite the limited data. The best model concerning start-up success prediction is determined by a Decision Tree, with an average effectiveness of 61%, 55%, and 52%, respectively. The AUC level for the Decision Tree achieved 58%, which is lower than the Logistic Regression and Random Forest scores (65%). But the last models had done so well by better predicting start-up failures, while more practical is the ability to predict their success. All models showed an acceptable level of AUC to confirm with confidence their effectiveness. The decision support system for the investment object can be helpful for entrepreneurs, venture analysts, or politicians who can use the built models to predict the success of a start-up. This forecast, in turn, can be used to drive better investment decisions and develop relevant economic policies to improve the overall start-up ecosystem",

    "title": "An Integrated Research Plan for the Tibetan Plateau Land–Air Coupled System and Its Impacts on the Global Climate",
    "abstract": "\nThe unique characteristics of land–air coupling and troposphere–stratosphere interaction over the Tibetan Plateau (TP), the highest landform in the world, play a vital role in weather and climate on regional and global scales. Although a great deal of research has been carried out, large gaps remain in our understanding of TP land–air coupling and its climate effects, due to a lack of observations and the issue of model biases. To address these obstacles, a 10-year national research program entitled “Changes in the Land–Air Coupled System over the Tibetan Plateau and its Impacts on Global Climate (LASTPIC)” was launched by the National Natural Science Foundation of China in January 2014. What LASTPIC does revolves around three aspects: TP land–air coupled processes; TP’s influence on global climate; reanalysis and model. This paper mainly focuses on the data collection, scientific understanding, and model development of LASTPIC in terms of TP land–atmosphere–ocean coupling and its global climate impacts since program’s inception.",

    "title": "Exploring the Linkages of Digital Food Communication and Analog Food Behavior: A Scoping Review",
    "abstract": "The linkages of digital food communication on social media platforms and analog food behavior of social media users are widely discussed in media and research, but less differentiated. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of the research field, the scientific studies are characterized by great heterogeneity in approaching the role of communication and modelling of food behavior, and thus also the conclusions on how digital food communication might be linked to analog food behavior. There is still much uncertainty regarding the relationship and underlying assumptions between digital communication and analog action. The rationale of this scoping review is to systematically summarize the findings of this heterogeneous body of knowledge. The importance and originality of this review are that it focuses explicitly on studies that provide insights into the nexus of digital food communication and analog food behavior, be it in the theoretical foundation, the results, or their interpretation. It draws on a socio-ecological model of food behavior that depicts food behavior variables in different domains and uses a differentiated categorization of food behavior (food choice, dietary intake, and eating behavior) to synthesize the results. Using the Web of Science and PubMed databases, 267 abstracts were identified and screened, of which 20 articles met the inclusion criteria and were selected for full-text analysis. The review offers some important insights on how different variables of the socio-ecological model of food behavior are related to digital food communication and different areas of analog food behavior. This review provides a more discerning understanding of which aspects of analog food behavior may be linked to social media food communication and in which ways. Implications are derived to reflect the role of communication in previous models of food behavior by adding a more nuanced and cross-cutting understanding of food communication.",

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on researching the scientific problem of deep extraction and inference of favorable geological and geochemical information about mineralization at depth, based on which a deep mineral resources prediction model is established and machine learning approaches are used to carry out deep quantitative mineral resources prediction. The main contents include: (i) discussing the method of 3D geochemical anomaly extraction under the multi-fractal content-volume (C-V) models, extracting the 12 element anomalies and constructing a 3D geochemical anomaly data volume model for laying the data foundation for researching geochemical element distribution and association; (ii) extracting the element association characteristics of primary geochemical halos and inferring deep metallogenic factors based on compositional data analysis (CoDA), including quantitatively extracting the geochemical element associations corresponding to ore-bearing structures (Sb-Hg) based on a data-driven CoDA framework, quantitatively identifying the front halo element association (As-Sb-Hg), near-ore halo element association (Au-Ag-Cu-Pb-Zn) and tail halo element association (W-Mo-Co-Bi), which provide quantitative indicators for the primary haloes’ structural analysis at depth; (iii) establishing a deep geological and geochemical mineral resources prediction model, which is constructed by five quantitative mineralization indicators as input variables: fracture buffer zone, element association (Sb-Hg) of ore-bearing structures, metallogenic element Au anomaly, near-ore halo element association Au-Ag-Cu-Pb-Zn and the ratio of front halo to tail halo (As-Sb-Hg)/(W-Mo-Bi); and (iv) three-dimensional MPM based on the maximum entropy model (MaxEnt) and Gaussian mixture model (GMM), and delineating exploration targets at depth. The results show that the C-V model can identify the geological element distribution and the CoDA method can extract geochemical element associations in 3D space reliably, and the machine learning methods of MaxEnt and GMM have high performance in 3D MPM.",

    "title": "Ecological and Cultural Understanding as a Basis for Management of a Globally Significant Island Landscape",
    "abstract": "Islands provide the opportunity to explore management regimes and research issues related to the isolation, uniqueness, and integrity of ecological systems. K’gari (Fraser Island) is an Australian World Heritage property listed based on its outstanding natural value, specifically, the unique wilderness characteristics and the diversity of ecosystem types. Our goal was to draw on an understanding of the natural and cultural environment of K’gari as a foundation on which to build a management model that includes First Nations Peoples in future management and research. Our research involved an analysis of papers in the peer-reviewed scientific literature, original reports, letters, and other manuscripts now housed in the K’gari Fraser Island Research Archive. The objectives of the research were: (1) to review key historical events that form the cultural, social, and environmental narrative; (2) review the major natural features of the island and threats; (3) identify the gaps in research; (4) analyse the management and conservation challenges associated with tourism, biosecurity threats, vegetation management practices, and climate change and discuss whether the requirements for sustaining island ecological integrity can be met in the future; and (5) identify commonalities and general management principles that may apply globally to other island systems and other World Heritage sites listed on the basis of their unique natural and cultural features. We found that the characteristics that contribute to island uniqueness are also constraints for research funding and publication; however, they are important themes that warrant more investment. Our review suggests that K’gari is a contested space between tourist visitation and associated environmental impacts, with an island that has rich First Nations history, extraordinary ecological diversity, and breathtaking aesthetic beauty. This juxtaposition is reflected in disparate views of custodianship and use, and the management strategies are needed to achieve multiple objectives in an environmentally sustainable way whilst creating cultural equity in modern times. We offer a foundation on which to build a co-management model that includes First Nations Peoples in governance, management, research, and monitoring.",

A well-off society should be an all-round developed society. Intangible cultural protection is an important foundation for rural revitalisation. Intangible culture is not only the regional cultural heritage, but also the foundation of regional economic development. Fully integrating culture with rural industries is conducive to the all-round development of rural society. The protection of intangible cultural heritage should be based on scientific methods. Scientific means must be used to investigate and calculate the quantity and types of intangible culture in the region, so as to formulate scientific protection strategies. At the same time, the protection of intangible cultural heritage should be organically combined with rural revitalisation, and the intangible cultural heritage resources should be utilised to innovate the regional economic development model, so as to form a benign interaction between economic development and cultural protection, that is, to realise a real sustainable development model.",

    "title": "Study on the Distance Learners’ Academic Emotions Using Online Learning Behavior Data",
    "abstract": "In recent years, computer vision, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other high-tech technologies have advanced rapidly. These strategies lay a new technical foundation for online learning and intelligent education by making it easier to promote the scientific, intelligent, and data-driven growth of learners’ academic emotions. However, at present, online learning can better make up for the shortcomings of traditional learning and enable people to realize distance learning. However, as an important indicator, learners’ learning emotion has a direct impact on learners’ learning quality and effect. Therefore, this paper analyzes distance learners’ academic emotions based on online learning behavior data. It extracts online learning behavior data by using a deep learning algorithm and multimodal weighted feature fusion based on DS (Dempster-Shafer) evidence theory, establishing distance learners’ academic cognition motivation model, and constructs an online learning emotion measurement framework. Finally, it is determined through a correlation study of distance learners’ academic emotions and learning impacts those learners’ academic emotions in class. It will have a beneficial influence on learning since learners’ academic emotion is favorably connected with instructors’ emotion, and learners’ addition, deletion, and modification behavior is positively correlated with learners’ academic emotion.",

    "title": "Immune‐mediated pathology as a consequence of impaired immune reactions: the IMPATH paradox",
    "abstract": "Traditionally, immune‐mediated pathology is considered to result from hyperactivity of the immune system. In recent years, however, it has become apparent that, paradoxically, immunopathology can also occur as a consequence of impaired, immune reactions. This insight has important consequences. In the case of hyperactivity, immune suppression is the method of choice for therapy. By contrast, patients suffering from immunopathology as a consequence of impaired immune reactions may benefit instead from immune stimulation or immune reconstitution. This concept is what we call the “IMPATH paradox.” The scientific and clinical impact of the IMPATH paradox is the focus of the collaborative research center CRC1160, funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) since 2015. The CRC examines human and murine model situations, in which the causal link between impaired immune reactions and immunopathology can be explored and better mechanistically defined. In this series of review articles, we wish to place some of these models into the context of the IMPATH paradox and illustrate their potential to stimulate novel perspectives on immunopathology and its therapy.",

    "title": "FEATURES OF INTERNATIONAL EXPERIENCE IN AIRPORT DEVELOPMENT ON INNOVATIVE BASIS",
    "abstract": "Introduction. In the war and post-war periods for Ukraine, the issue of socio-economic development on an innovative basis receives special attention. One of such important and promising directions in Ukraine today as an equal and competitive partnership in the system of international trade and economic relations can be the development of the aviation sector, in particular in the direction of airport operations. The foundation of the expanded reproduction of the potential of the airport and its infrastructural component in the wartime and postwar period is the timely implementation of advanced innovative technologies based on efficiency and systematicity. In the implementation of a successful innovative model of airport development, as evidenced by international experience, a decisive role is played by the system of state regulation, which operates with effective coordination-integration, administrative-fiscal financial-investment levers and tools of strategic, regulatory, legal and resource support of state economic policy. On the other hand, in Ukraine, as a result of the attack of the Russian Federation in the field of airport development on an innovative basis in the aviation field, the trends of critical deterioration of the technical and economic parameters of the functioning of the airport infrastructure are increasing. Under such circumstances, the state priority should be the solution of the extremely difficult task, which consists in ending the war, liberating the territories of Ukraine from the aggressor of the Russian Federation, restoring the socio-economic development of the regions of the country, restoring the activities of airports on the basis of innovative transformations, which require the development and implementation of adequate requirements and imperatives of public , scientific and technical progress of the integral concept of modernization of the state regulation of innovative development of the airport infrastructure. Materials and methods. Informational and statistical materials, normative legal acts, and national airport development programs made up the information base of the research. The positive international experience of airport development can be used in Ukraine in the war and post-war periods for the purpose of economic recovery of the country. Results and discussion. As a result of the research of international experience regarding the functioning of airports on an innovative basis, it was found that there are the main factors of their functioning in the countries. Unlike the countries of the world, there are factors in Ukraine that restrain their development, in particular, the presence of military actions in connection with Russia's attack on Ukraine. In this regard, the international experience of the operation of airports in the war and post-war periods was analyzed. Peculiarities of institutional support for the functioning of airports, development of cooperation, etc. are considered. Conclusions. Based on the study of the peculiarities of the functioning of airports, proposals have been developed for their activation in Ukraine during the war and post-war periods. A significant development is the development of proposals in the direction of the introduction of concession agreements in Ukraine, taking into account the peculiarities of the experience of the countries of the world.",

The talent cultivation concept of “education as the core, foundation as the root, practice as the base, and innovation as the soul” is proposed. Talent training objectives and graduation requirements based on the OBE education concept and emerging engineering education requirements are developed. Curriculum system based on training objectives and graduation requirements is constructed. A collaborative education platform based on university-enterprise cooperation is provided. Then, it explores the innovative talent cultivation model of robotics in the context of emerging engineering education by “con-structing a scientific curriculum system, building a diversified practice platform, and promoting the deep integration of industry and education”.",

    "title": "Aesthetics without Objects: Towards a Process-Oriented Aesthetic Perception",
    "abstract": "In this paper, I suggest an aesthetic model that is consistent with anti-foundational scientific knowledge. How has an aesthetics without foundation to be configured? In contrast to the conventional subject/object model, with idealistic and subjective aesthetics, but also with object-oriented assumptions, I suggest that aesthetics has to be characterized as relational aesthetics in terms of process-oriented perception and that this leads to an Aesthetics Without Objects (AWO) approach. The relational nature of processes means that they do not happen inter-, that is, between ontologically delimited and stable entities, but rather they correspond between relations. I will try to show that AWO matches well with the onto-phenomenological-epistemic and relational models proposed by recent theories in different fields of science, especially in the relational interpretation of quantum physics. The field of aesthetics, then, does not indicate perceptual fixed contents—either subjective or objectual properties—rather it emerges from a correspondence occurring in an engaged and situated perceptual movement, an agencing that is prior to any sharp distinction between a perceiver and a perceived. I propose to call haptic this perceptual agencing. In the first section, I describe the reasons according to which the adoption of AWO seems more correct and advisable, both with respect to contemporary scientific models and to the current ecological changes on the planet. In the second section, I portray some characteristics of AWO. In the third section, I argue that AWO calls for haptic perception. In the fourth section, I briefly draw some meta-aesthetics consequences concerning, on the one side, socio-political issues of AWO and, on the other side, the possibility for a theory in an anti-foundational model. I conclude with a proposal: a process-oriented aesthetics approach has to be understood mainly as an art of thinking. This means rethinking and re-evaluating the idea of aesthetics as an artisan thought.",

The output target to be achieved is being able to produce scientific papers published in accredited national journals and can be used as references in the development of teaching materials. The analysis technique used in this research is multiple linear regression. Prior to the analysis using the model, the instrument test and classical assumption test were first carried out as a prerequisite for the regression test. The population of this research is the entire financial team of the Triatma Surya Jaya Foundation. The sample used in this study was selected using purposive sampling using the criteria of employees who already use accounting information systems. The results show that partially the application of accounting information systems has a positive effect on employee performance, while its composition has a negative effect on employee performance, but simultaneously the application of accounting information systems affects employee performance in the Triatma Surya Jaya Foundation.",

    "title": "DNABERT-2: Efficient Foundation Model and Benchmark For Multi-Species Genome",
    "abstract": "Decoding the linguistic intricacies of the genome is a crucial problem in biology, and pre-trained foundational models such as DNABERT and Nucleotide Transformer have made significant strides in this area. Existing works have largely hinged on k-mer, fixed-length permutations of A, T, C, and G, as the token of the genome language due to its simplicity. However, we argue that the computation and sample inefficiencies introduced by k-mer tokenization are primary obstacles in developing large genome foundational models. We provide conceptual and empirical insights into genome tokenization, building on which we propose to replace k-mer tokenization with Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), a statistics-based data compression algorithm that constructs tokens by iteratively merging the most frequent co-occurring genome segment in the corpus. We demonstrate that BPE not only overcomes the limitations of k-mer tokenization but also benefits from the computational efficiency of non-overlapping tokenization. Based on these insights, we introduce DNABERT-2, a refined genome foundation model that adapts an efficient tokenizer and employs multiple strategies to overcome input length constraints, reduce time and memory expenditure, and enhance model capability. Furthermore, we identify the absence of a comprehensive and standardized benchmark for genome understanding as another significant impediment to fair comparative analysis. In response, we propose the Genome Understanding Evaluation (GUE), a comprehensive multi-species genome classification dataset that amalgamates $36$ distinct datasets across $9$ tasks, with input lengths ranging from $70$ to $10000$. Through comprehensive experiments on the GUE benchmark, we demonstrate that DNABERT-2 achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art model with $21 \\times$ fewer parameters and approximately $92 \\times$ less GPU time in pre-training.",

    "title": "SpectralGPT: Spectral Remote Sensing Foundation Model",
    "abstract": "The foundation model has recently garnered significant attention due to its potential to revolutionize the field of visual representation learning in a self-supervised manner. While most foundation models are tailored to effectively process RGB images for various visual tasks, there is a noticeable gap in research focused on spectral data, which offers valuable information for scene understanding, especially in remote sensing (RS) applications. To fill this gap, we created for the first time a universal RS foundation model, named SpectralGPT, which is purpose-built to handle spectral RS images using a novel 3D generative pretrained transformer (GPT). Compared to existing foundation models, SpectralGPT 1) accommodates input images with varying sizes, resolutions, time series, and regions in a progressive training fashion, enabling full utilization of extensive RS Big Data; 2) leverages 3D token generation for spatial-spectral coupling; 3) captures spectrally sequential patterns via multi-target reconstruction; and 4) trains on one million spectral RS images, yielding models with over 600 million parameters. Our evaluation highlights significant performance improvements with pretrained SpectralGPT models, signifying substantial potential in advancing spectral RS Big Data applications within the field of geoscience across four downstream tasks: single/multi-label scene classification, semantic segmentation, and change detection.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we aim to initiate the development of Radiology Foundation Model, termed as RadFM. We consider the construction of foundational models from three perspectives, namely, dataset construction, model design, and thorough evaluation. Our contribution can be concluded as follows: (i), we construct a large-scale Medical Multi-modal Dataset, MedMD, which consists of 16M 2D and 3D medical scans with high-quality text descriptions or reports across various data formats, modalities, and tasks, covering over 5000 distinct diseases. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale, high-quality, medical visual-language dataset, with both 2D and 3D scans; (ii), we propose an architecture that enables visually conditioned generative pre-training, i.e., allowing for integration of text input with 2D or 3D medical scans, and generate responses for diverse radiologic tasks. The model was initially pre-trained on MedMD and subsequently fine-tuned on the domain-specific dataset, which is a radiologic cleaned version of MedMD, containing 3M radiologic visual-language pairs, termed as RadMD; (iii), we propose a new evaluation benchmark, RadBench, that comprises five tasks, including modality recognition, disease diagnosis, visual question answering, report generation and rationale diagnosis, aiming to comprehensively assess the capability of foundation models in handling practical clinical problems. We conduct both automatic and human evaluation on RadBench, in both cases, RadFM outperforms existing multi-modal foundation models, that are publicaly accessible, including Openflamingo, MedFlamingo, MedVInT and GPT-4V. Additionally, we also adapt RadFM for different public benchmarks, surpassing existing SOTAs on diverse datasets. All codes, data, and model checkpoint will all be made publicly available to promote further research and development in the field.",

Developing foundation models in life science for deciphering the “languages” of cells and facilitating biomedical research is promising yet challenging. We developed a large-scale pretrained model scFoundation with 100M parameters for this purpose. scFoundation was trained on over 50 million human single-cell transcriptomics data, which contain high-throughput observations on the complex molecular features in all known types of cells. scFoundation is currently the largest model in terms of the size of trainable parameters, dimensionality of genes and the number of cells used in the pre-training. Experiments showed that scFoundation can serve as a foundation model for single-cell transcriptomics and achieve state-of-the-art performances in a diverse array of downstream tasks, such as gene expression enhancement, tissue drug response prediction, single-cell drug response classification, and single-cell perturbation prediction.",

    "title": "ClimaX: A foundation model for weather and climate",
    "abstract": "Most state-of-the-art approaches for weather and climate modeling are based on physics-informed numerical models of the atmosphere. These approaches aim to model the non-linear dynamics and complex interactions between multiple variables, which are challenging to approximate. Additionally, many such numerical models are computationally intensive, especially when modeling the atmospheric phenomenon at a fine-grained spatial and temporal resolution. Recent data-driven approaches based on machine learning instead aim to directly solve a downstream forecasting or projection task by learning a data-driven functional mapping using deep neural networks. However, these networks are trained using curated and homogeneous climate datasets for specific spatiotemporal tasks, and thus lack the generality of numerical models. We develop and demonstrate ClimaX, a flexible and generalizable deep learning model for weather and climate science that can be trained using heterogeneous datasets spanning different variables, spatio-temporal coverage, and physical groundings. ClimaX extends the Transformer architecture with novel encoding and aggregation blocks that allow effective use of available compute while maintaining general utility. ClimaX is pre-trained with a self-supervised learning objective on climate datasets derived from CMIP6. The pre-trained ClimaX can then be fine-tuned to address a breadth of climate and weather tasks, including those that involve atmospheric variables and spatio-temporal scales unseen during pretraining. Compared to existing data-driven baselines, we show that this generality in ClimaX results in superior performance on benchmarks for weather forecasting and climate projections, even when pretrained at lower resolutions and compute budgets.

    "title": "A Billion-scale Foundation Model for Remote Sensing Images",
    "abstract": "As the potential of foundation models in visual tasks has garnered significant attention, pretraining these models before downstream tasks has become a crucial step. The three key factors in pretraining foundation models are the pretraining method, the size of the pretraining dataset, and the number of model parameters. Recently, research in the remote sensing field has focused primarily on the pretraining method and the size of the dataset, with limited emphasis on the number of model parameters. This paper addresses this gap by examining the effect of increasing the number of model parameters on the performance of foundation models in downstream tasks such as rotated object detection and semantic segmentation. We pretrained foundation models with varying numbers of parameters, including 86M, 605.26M, 1.3B, and 2.4B, to determine whether performance in downstream tasks improved with an increase in parameters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first billion-scale foundation model in the remote sensing field. Furthermore, we propose an effective method for scaling up and fine-tuning a vision transformer in the remote sensing field. To evaluate general performance in downstream tasks, we employed the DOTA v2.0 and DIOR-R benchmark datasets for rotated object detection, and the Potsdam and LoveDA datasets for semantic segmentation. Experimental results demonstrated that, across all benchmark datasets and downstream tasks, the performance of the foundation models and data efficiency improved as the number of parameters increased. Moreover, our models achieve the state-of-the-art performance on several datasets including DIOR-R, Postdam, and LoveDA.",

    "abstract": "\n In this work, we apply self-supervised learning with instance differentiation to learn a robust, multi-purpose representation for image analysis of resolved extragalactic continuum images. We train a multi-use model which compresses our unlabelled data into a structured, low dimensional representation which can be used for a variety of downstream tasks (e.g. classification, similarity search). We exceed baseline supervised Fanaroff-Riley classification performance by a statistically significant margin, with our model reducing the test set error by up to half. Our model is also able to maintain high classification accuracy with very few labels, with only $7.79{{\\%}}$ error when only using 145 labels. We further demonstrate that by using our foundation model, users can efficiently trade off compute, human labelling cost and test set accuracy according to their respective budgets, allowing for efficient classification in a wide variety of scenarios. We highlight the generalizability of our model by showing that it enables accurate classification in a label scarce regime with data from the new MIGHTEE survey without any hyper-parameter tuning, where it improves upon the baseline by $\\sim 8{{\\%}}$ . Visualizations of our labelled and un-labelled data show that our model’s representation space is structured with respect to physical properties of the sources, such as angular source extent. We show that the learned representation is scientifically useful even if no labels are available by performing a similarity search, finding hybrid sources in the RGZ DR1 data-set without any labels. We show that good augmentation design and hyper-parameter choice can help achieve peak performance, while emphasising that optimal hyper-parameters are not required to obtain benefits from self-supervised pre-training.",

    "title": "O-321 A foundation model for embryology trained on time-lapse images",
    "abstract": "\n \n \n Can a generalizable computer vision foundation model be trained using self-supervised learning on time-lapse embryo images to perform multiple clinically relevant downstream tasks?\n \n \n \n We developed FEMI, a foundation model trained on eight million time-lapse images, to perform multiple clinical tasks, including blastocyst quality scoring, ploidy prediction, and segmentation.\n \n \n \n In vitro fertilization success critically depends on choosing viable embryos, a process hampered by current limited diagnostic tools, high costs, and ethical concerns. In recent years, various medical fields have increasingly explored foundation models using vision transformer architectures. These models, trained in a self-supervised manner on vast unlabeled image datasets, perform various clinically relevant tasks. Once trained on a massive unlabeled dataset, the encoder portion of the foundation model can be extracted and subsequently fine-tuned with a labeled dataset to perform various clinically relevant tasks like classification, regression, and segmentation.\n \n \n \n The foundation model was trained on 8 million Embryoscope® (E-SD) and Embryoscope+® (E+) images spanning clinics in the United States, Canada, and Europe. Datasets contained various additional information, such as ploidy status, blastocyst scores (numerical values from 3 to 14 based on Zhan et al. 2020), and segmentation masks (for trophectoderm [TE], inner cell mass [ICM], and zona pellucida [ZP]) that were used for training downstream tasks.\n \n \n \n A masked autoencoder architecture is trained on time-lapse images to create a foundation model (FEMI). The encoder from the autoencoder is extracted and fine-tuned on three image-based downstream tasks: ploidy prediction, blastocyst scoring, and embryo component segmentation. The performance of the fine-tuned foundation model is compared to VGG16 architectures, specifically trained for each downstream task. We evaluated performances using the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic (AUROC), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean intersection over union (mIoU).\n \n \n \n The training dataset for the downstream tasks consisted of image data and labels, including PGT-A ploidy results (euploid or aneuploid), blastocyst scores (3-14), and segmentation masks. No clinical data like maternal age was used in order to assess FEMI’s learning capabilities from only time-lapse images against VGG16 model baselines. Both FEMI and baseline models used the same data splits for consistent comparisons. For ploidy prediction, models trained on a Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM) dataset were validated using WCM, Florida, and Spain data. FEMI achieved a 0.610 ± 0.004 AUROC, outperforming the baseline’s 0.590 ± 0.005. In blastocyst score prediction, FEMI attained a superior MAE of 0.099 ± 0.002 compared to the baseline’s 0.118 ± 0.001. For embryo segmentation (TE, ICM, ZP), a publicly available dataset from Simon Fraser University was split for training and validation. FEMI exceeded the baseline in mIoU for TE segmentation (0.738 ± 0.002 vs. 0.726 ± 0.002) and was comparable in ICM (0.832 ± 0.008 vs. 0.821 ± 0.011) and ZP segmentation (0.779 ± 0.002 vs. 0.778 ± 0.010).\n \n \n \n The current version of FEMI is trained on a subset of our available datasets and can be improved through further training. Moreover, the downstream ploidy and blastocyst score models may be biased by errors in PGT results and the subjectivity of embryologists, respectively.\n \n \n \n A generalizable foundational model for IVF time-lapse imaging aids clinicians in embryo selection by providing various clinical insights for better decision-making. FEMI, once fully trained, will be publicly accessible to the scientific community allowing for researchers to fine-tune FEMI on their own clinic-specific applications with their own image datasets.\n \n \n \n not applicable\n",

    "title": "CoRAST: Towards Foundation Model-Powered Correlated Data Analysis in Resource-Constrained CPS and IoT",
    "abstract": "Foundation models (FMs) emerge as a promising solution to harness distributed and diverse environmental data by leveraging prior knowledge to understand the complicated temporal and spatial correlations within heterogeneous datasets. Unlike distributed learning frameworks such as federated learning’ which often struggle with multimodal data, FMs can trans-form diverse inputs into embeddings. This process facilitates the integration of information from various modalities and the application of prior learning to new domains. However, deploying FMs in resource-constrained edge systems poses significant challenges. To this end, we introduce CoRAST, a novel learning framework that utilizes FMs for enhanced analysis of distributed, correlated heterogeneous data. Utilizing a server-based FM, CoRAST exploits existing environment information to extract temporal, and cross-feature correlations among sensor data. This enables CoRAST to offer context-aware insights for localized client tasks through FM-powered global representation learning. Our evaluation on real-world weather dataset demonstrates CoRAST's ability to exploit correlated heterogeneous data through environmental representation learning to reduce the forecast errors by up to 50.3% compared to the baselines.",

    "abstract": "The exponential growth of large language models (LLMs) has opened up numerous possibilities for multi-modal AGI systems. However, the progress in vision and vision-language foundation models, which are also critical elements of multi-modal AGI, has not kept pace with LLMs. In this work, we design a large-scale vision-language foun-dation model (Intern VL), which scales up the vision foun-dation model to 6 billion parameters and progressively aligns it with the LLM, using web-scale image-text data from various sources. This model can be broadly applied to and achieve state-of-the-art performance on 32 generic visual-linguistic benchmarks including visual perception tasks such as image-level or pixel-level recognition, vision-language tasks such as zero-shot image/video classification, zero-shot image/video-text retrieval, and link with LLMs to create multi-modal dialogue systems. It has powerful visual capabilities and can be a good alternative to the ViT-22B. We hope that our research could contribute to the development of multi-modal large models.",

    "title": "Visual ChatGPT: Talking, Drawing and Editing with Visual Foundation Models",
    "abstract": "ChatGPT is attracting a cross-field interest as it provides a language interface with remarkable conversational competency and reasoning capabilities across many domains. However, since ChatGPT is trained with languages, it is currently not capable of processing or generating images from the visual world. At the same time, Visual Foundation Models, such as Visual Transformers or Stable Diffusion, although showing great visual understanding and generation capabilities, they are only experts on specific tasks with one-round fixed inputs and outputs. To this end, We build a system called \\textbf{Visual ChatGPT}, incorporating different Visual Foundation Models, to enable the user to interact with ChatGPT by 1) sending and receiving not only languages but also images 2) providing complex visual questions or visual editing instructions that require the collaboration of multiple AI models with multi-steps. 3) providing feedback and asking for corrected results. We design a series of prompts to inject the visual model information into ChatGPT, considering models of multiple inputs/outputs and models that require visual feedback. Experiments show that Visual ChatGPT opens the door to investigating the visual roles of ChatGPT with the help of Visual Foundation Models. Our system is publicly available at \\url{https://github.com/microsoft/visual-chatgpt}.",

    "title": "AGIEval: A Human-Centric Benchmark for Evaluating Foundation Models",
    "abstract": "Evaluating the general abilities of foundation models to tackle human-level tasks is a vital aspect of their development and application in the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Traditional benchmarks, which rely on artificial datasets, may not accurately represent human-level capabilities. In this paper, we introduce AGIEval, a novel benchmark specifically designed to assess foundation model in the context of human-centric standardized exams, such as college entrance exams, law school admission tests, math competitions, and lawyer qualification tests. We evaluate several state-of-the-art foundation models, including GPT-4, ChatGPT, and Text-Davinci-003, using this benchmark. Impressively, GPT-4 surpasses average human performance on SAT, LSAT, and math competitions, attaining a 95% accuracy rate on the SAT Math test and a 92.5% accuracy on the English test of the Chinese national college entrance exam. This demonstrates the extraordinary performance of contemporary foundation models. In contrast, we also find that GPT-4 is less proficient in tasks that require complex reasoning or specific domain knowledge. Our comprehensive analyses of model capabilities (understanding, knowledge, reasoning, and calculation) reveal these models' strengths and limitations, providing valuable insights into future directions for enhancing their general capabilities. By concentrating on tasks pertinent to human cognition and decision-making, our benchmark delivers a more meaningful and robust evaluation of foundation models' performance in real-world scenarios. The data, code, and all model outputs are released in https://github.com/ruixiangcui/AGIEval.",

    "title": "CoCa: Contrastive Captioners are Image-Text Foundation Models",
    "abstract": "Exploring large-scale pretrained foundation models is of significant interest in computer vision because these models can be quickly transferred to many downstream tasks. This paper presents Contrastive Captioner (CoCa), a minimalist design to pretrain an image-text encoder-decoder foundation model jointly with contrastive loss and captioning loss, thereby subsuming model capabilities from contrastive approaches like CLIP and generative methods like SimVLM. In contrast to standard encoder-decoder transformers where all decoder layers attend to encoder outputs, CoCa omits cross-attention in the first half of decoder layers to encode unimodal text representations, and cascades the remaining decoder layers which cross-attend to the image encoder for multimodal image-text representations. We apply a contrastive loss between unimodal image and text embeddings, in addition to a captioning loss on the multimodal decoder outputs which predicts text tokens autoregressively. By sharing the same computational graph, the two training objectives are computed efficiently with minimal overhead. CoCa is pretrained end-to-end and from scratch on both web-scale alt-text data and annotated images by treating all labels simply as text, seamlessly unifying natural language supervision for representation learning. Empirically, CoCa achieves state-of-the-art performance with zero-shot transfer or minimal task-specific adaptation on a broad range of downstream tasks, spanning visual recognition (ImageNet, Kinetics-400/600/700, Moments-in-Time), crossmodal retrieval (MSCOCO, Flickr30K, MSR-VTT), multimodal understanding (VQA, SNLI-VE, NLVR2), and image captioning (MSCOCO, NoCaps). Notably on ImageNet classification, CoCa obtains 86.3% zero-shot top-1 accuracy, 90.6% with a frozen encoder and learned classification head, and new state-of-the-art 91.0% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with a finetuned encoder.",

    "title": "A Comprehensive Survey on Pretrained Foundation Models: A History from BERT to ChatGPT",
    "abstract": "Pretrained Foundation Models (PFMs) are regarded as the foundation for various downstream tasks with different data modalities. A PFM (e.g., BERT, ChatGPT, and GPT-4) is trained on large-scale data which provides a reasonable parameter initialization for a wide range of downstream applications. BERT learns bidirectional encoder representations from Transformers, which are trained on large datasets as contextual language models. Similarly, the generative pretrained transformer (GPT) method employs Transformers as the feature extractor and is trained using an autoregressive paradigm on large datasets. Recently, ChatGPT shows promising success on large language models, which applies an autoregressive language model with zero shot or few shot prompting. The remarkable achievements of PFM have brought significant breakthroughs to various fields of AI. Numerous studies have proposed different methods, raising the demand for an updated survey. This study provides a comprehensive review of recent research advancements, challenges, and opportunities for PFMs in text, image, graph, as well as other data modalities. The review covers the basic components and existing pretraining methods used in natural language processing, computer vision, and graph learning. Additionally, it explores advanced PFMs used for different data modalities and unified PFMs that consider data quality and quantity. The review also discusses research related to the fundamentals of PFMs, such as model efficiency and compression, security, and privacy. Finally, the study provides key implications, future research directions, challenges, and open problems in the field of PFMs. Overall, this survey aims to shed light on the research of the PFMs on scalability, security, logical reasoning ability, cross-domain learning ability, and the user-friendly interactive ability for artificial general intelligence.",

Dr Eugen Ozarkevych, the founder and later the Chair of the Shevchenko Scientific Society’s Medical Commission in Lviv, initiated the publication of the scientific and practical journal “Medical Collection” («Лікарський збірник») in 1898. The journal’s primary purpose was to promulgate scientific achievements in the field of medicine in Ukrainian and to create Ukrainian medical terminology. This format allowed the reader to review scientific achievements in fundamental and clinical medicine, current medical problems, and new methods to in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of various diseases. Ukrainian professional medical terminology was presented in this journal for the first time. Throughout its existence, this oldest medical journal, Medical Sciences, remains faithful to its historical multidisciplinary orientation. During the information and Russian war on the territory of Ukraine, Medical Sciences serves as a national heritage of Ukraine. It is recognized by international partners and indexed in scientometric bibliographic databases such as Scopus, Copernicus, Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ), and Google Scholar. As an Open Access Journal, it is read in 155 countries of the world.",

    "abstract": "Compared to the great progress of large-scale vision transformers (ViTs) in recent years, large-scale models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are still in an early state. This work presents a new large-scale CNN-based foundation model, termed InternImage, which can obtain the gain from increasing parameters and training data like ViTs. Different from the recent CNNs that focus on large dense kernels, InternImage takes deformable convolution as the core operator, so that our model not only has the large effective receptive field required for downstream tasks such as detection and segmentation, but also has the adaptive spatial aggregation conditioned by input and task information. As a result, the proposed InternImage reduces the strict inductive bias of traditional CNNs and makes it possible to learn stronger and more robust patterns with large-scale parameters from massive data like ViTs. The effectiveness of our model is proven on challenging benchmarks including ImageNet, COCO, andADE20K. It is worth mentioning that InternImage-H achieved a new record 65.4 mAP on COCO test-dev and 62.9 mIoU on ADE20K, outperforming current leading CNNs and ViTs.",

    "title": "Foundation Models and Fair Use",
    "abstract": "Existing foundation models are trained on copyrighted material. Deploying these models can pose both legal and ethical risks when data creators fail to receive appropriate attribution or compensation. In the United States and several other countries, copyrighted content may be used to build foundation models without incurring liability due to the fair use doctrine. However, there is a caveat: If the model produces output that is similar to copyrighted data, particularly in scenarios that affect the market of that data, fair use may no longer apply to the output of the model. In this work, we emphasize that fair use is not guaranteed, and additional work may be necessary to keep model development and deployment squarely in the realm of fair use. First, we survey the potential risks of developing and deploying foundation models based on copyrighted content. We review relevant U.S. case law, drawing parallels to existing and potential applications for generating text, source code, and visual art. Experiments confirm that popular foundation models can generate content considerably similar to copyrighted material. Second, we discuss technical mitigations that can help foundation models stay in line with fair use. We argue that more research is needed to align mitigation strategies with the current state of the law. Lastly, we suggest that the law and technical mitigations should co-evolve. For example, coupled with other policy mechanisms, the law could more explicitly consider safe harbors when strong technical tools are used to mitigate infringement harms. This co-evolution may help strike a balance between intellectual property and innovation, which speaks to the original goal of fair use. But we emphasize that the strategies we describe here are not a panacea and more work is needed to develop policies that address the potential harms of foundation models.",

    "abstract": "New NLP benchmarks are urgently needed to align with the rapid development of large language models (LLMs). We present C-Eval, the first comprehensive Chinese evaluation suite designed to assess advanced knowledge and reasoning abilities of foundation models in a Chinese context. C-Eval comprises multiple-choice questions across four difficulty levels: middle school, high school, college, and professional. The questions span 52 diverse disciplines, ranging from humanities to science and engineering. C-Eval is accompanied by C-Eval Hard, a subset of very challenging subjects in C-Eval that requires advanced reasoning abilities to solve. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the most advanced LLMs on C-Eval, including both English- and Chinese-oriented models. Results indicate that only GPT-4 could achieve an average accuracy of over 60%, suggesting that there is still significant room for improvement for current LLMs. We anticipate C-Eval will help analyze important strengths and shortcomings of foundation models, and foster their development and growth for Chinese users.",

    "title": "Scientific and Technical Capacity of Regions as the Foundation for Technological Independence of the Russian Federation",
    "abstract": "Ensuring technological independence is one of the key challenges for modern Russia. Solution of this problem requires the consideration of the development of the scientific and technical capacity of Russian regions. The study aims to establish theoretical and methodological bases of the scientific and technical capacity of Russian regions as the foundation for technological independence. To this end, the following tasks were set: to present the definition of the scientific and technical capacity of regions; to create a methodology for managing capacity building; to develop methodological approaches to increase the ability of the scientific and technical capacity of regions to solve the problems of technological independence. The research used statistical data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Federal Customs Service of Russia, Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat), and other sources. Analysis of the import dependence of the Russian Federation shows that the rate of coverage of imports by exports for the majority of high-tech goods does not exceed 5–10 %. The genesis of the concept of the scientific and technical capacity of regions was examined taking into account the innovation theory and changes in knowledge flows in the context of the digital society. The study identified barriers to the development of the scientific and technical capacity of Russian regions: technological backwardness and financial instability of the high-tech sector, low willingness to update, imbalance in the structure of the scientific and technical capacity, etc. A methodology for overcoming these barriers based on an integrated approach to regional innovation processes was presented. Additionally, a methodological approach to enhancing the interaction between science and business relying on the open innovation model was proposed. Calculations performed using the hierarchical cluster analysis revealed a group of the most promising regions for the establishment of innovative development centres. Three clusters were identified (in descending order of priority): leading (4 constituent entities), advanced (6 constituent entities) and developed (3 constituent entities) regions. The obtained results can be used to manage regional scientific and technological development and create the methodology for innovative transformation of the Russian economy.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to identify the main scientific challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in Georgia. The facts are based on the: statistics of budget allocation to science promotion and grant financing by the Ministry of Education and Science of Georgia and the Shota Rustaveli National Science Foundation of Georgia (SRNSFG). The major obstacles faced by the scientific community due to the pandemic are also described below. As expected, grants for scientific research were reduced during the pandemic. It is obvious that as well as financial problems, the pandemic has caused many other scientific obstacles. It is important to identify these problems and consider the SRNSFG’s approach to reducing them. By conducting research on this issue, the author of this report concludes that the pandemic caused both financial and logistical problems in the scientific community of Georgia. Regardless of the circumstances, the measures implemented in the Georgian education system have been positively evaluated by some international organisations, such as: Microsoft, UNICEF, and the OECD.",

    "abstract": "We present SeaEval, a benchmark for multilingual foundation models. In addition to characterizing how these models understand and reason with natural language, we also investigate how well they comprehend cultural practices, nuances, and values. Alongside standard accuracy metrics, we investigate the brittleness of foundation models in the dimensions of semantics and multilinguality. Our analyses span both open-sourced and closed models, leading to empirical results across classic NLP tasks, reasoning, and cultural comprehension. Key findings indicate (1) Many models exhibit varied behavior when given paraphrased instructions. (2) Many models still suffer from exposure bias (e.g., positional bias, majority label bias). (3) For questions rooted in factual, scientific, and commonsense knowledge, consistent responses are expected across multilingual queries that are semantically equivalent. Yet, most models surprisingly demonstrate inconsistent performance on these queries. (4) Multilingually-trained models have not attained “balanced multilingual” capabilities. Our endeavors underscore the need for more generalizable semantic representations and enhanced multilingual contextualization. SeaEval can serve as a launchpad for more thorough investigations and evaluations for multilingual and multicultural scenarios.",

    "title": "TaskMatrix.AI: Completing Tasks by Connecting Foundation Models with Millions of APIs",
    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made incredible progress recently. On the one hand, advanced foundation models like ChatGPT can offer powerful conversation, in-context learning and code generation abilities on a broad range of open-domain tasks. They can also generate high-level solution outlines for domain-specific tasks based on the common sense knowledge they have acquired. However, they still face difficulties with some specialized tasks because they lack enough domain-specific data during pre-training or they often have errors in their neural network computations on those tasks that need accurate executions. On the other hand, there are also many existing models and systems (symbolic-based or neural-based) that can do some domain-specific tasks very well. However, due to the different implementation or working mechanisms, they are not easily accessible or compatible with foundation models. Therefore, there is a clear and pressing need for a mechanism that can leverage foundation models to propose task solution outlines and then automatically match some of the sub-tasks in the outlines to the off-the-shelf models and systems with special functionalities to complete them. Inspired by this, we introduce TaskMatrix.AI as a new AI ecosystem that connects foundation models with millions of APIs for task completion. Unlike most previous work that aimed to improve a single AI model, TaskMatrix.AI focuses more on using existing foundation models (as a brain-like central system) and APIs of other AI models and systems (as sub-task solvers) to achieve diversified tasks in both digital and physical domains. As a position paper, we will present our vision of how to build such an ecosystem, explain each key component, and use study cases to illustrate both the feasibility of this vision and the main challenges we need to address next.",

The research landscape encompasses five core topics, categorized into two classes. (i) We start with a survey of well-established research areas: multimodal foundation models pre-trained for specific purposes, including two topics -- methods of learning vision backbones for visual understanding and text-to-image generation. (ii) Then, we present recent advances in exploratory, open research areas: multimodal foundation models that aim to play the role of general-purpose assistants, including three topics -- unified vision models inspired by large language models (LLMs), end-to-end training of multimodal LLMs, and chaining multimodal tools with LLMs. The target audiences of the paper are researchers, graduate students, and professionals in computer vision and vision-language multimodal communities who are eager to learn the basics and recent advances in multimodal foundation models.",

    "title": "Tool Learning with Foundation Models",
    "abstract": "\n Humans possess an extraordinary ability to create and utilize tools. With the advent of foundation models, artificial intelligence systems have the potential to be equally adept in tool use as humans. This paradigm, which is dubbed as\n tool learning with foundation models\n , combines the strengths of tools and foundation models to achieve enhanced accuracy, efficiency, and automation in problem-solving. This paper presents a systematic investigation and comprehensive review of tool learning. We first introduce the background of tool learning, including its cognitive origins, the paradigm shift of foundation models, and the complementary roles of tools and models. Then we recapitulate existing tool learning research and formulate a general framework: starting from understanding the user instruction, models should learn to decompose a complex task into several subtasks, dynamically adjust their plan through reasoning, and effectively conquer each sub-task by selecting appropriate tools. We also discuss how to train models for improved tool-use capabilities and facilitate generalization in tool learning. Finally, we discuss several open problems that require further investigation, such as ensuring trustworthy tool use, enabling tool creation with foundation models, and addressing personalization challenges. Overall, we hope this paper could inspire future research in integrating tools with foundation models.\n",

    "title": "Foundation Models for Decision Making: Problems, Methods, and Opportunities",
    "abstract": "Foundation models pretrained on diverse data at scale have demonstrated extraordinary capabilities in a wide range of vision and language tasks. When such models are deployed in real world environments, they inevitably interface with other entities and agents. For example, language models are often used to interact with human beings through dialogue, and visual perception models are used to autonomously navigate neighborhood streets. In response to these developments, new paradigms are emerging for training foundation models to interact with other agents and perform long-term reasoning. These paradigms leverage the existence of ever-larger datasets curated for multimodal, multitask, and generalist interaction. Research at the intersection of foundation models and decision making holds tremendous promise for creating powerful new systems that can interact effectively across a diverse range of applications such as dialogue, autonomous driving, healthcare, education, and robotics. In this manuscript, we examine the scope of foundation models for decision making, and provide conceptual tools and technical background for understanding the problem space and exploring new research directions. We review recent approaches that ground foundation models in practical decision making applications through a variety of methods such as prompting, conditional generative modeling, planning, optimal control, and reinforcement learning, and discuss common challenges and open problems in the field.",

    "abstract": "Large pretrained models such as GPT-3 have had tremendous impact on modern natural language processing by leveraging self-supervised learning to learn salient representations that can be used to readily finetune on a wide variety of downstream tasks. We investigate the possibility of transferring such advances to molecular machine learning by building a chemical foundation model, ChemBERTa-2, using the language of SMILES. While labeled data for molecular prediction tasks is typically scarce, libraries of SMILES strings are readily available. In this work, we build upon ChemBERTa by optimizing the pretraining process. We compare multi-task and self-supervised pretraining by varying hyperparameters and pretraining dataset size, up to 77M compounds from PubChem. To our knowledge, the 77M set constitutes one of the largest datasets used for molecular pretraining to date. We find that with these pretraining improvements, we are competitive with existing state-of-the-art architectures on the MoleculeNet benchmark suite. We analyze the degree to which improvements in pretraining translate to improvement on downstream tasks.",

    "title": "SSL4EO-L: Datasets and Foundation Models for Landsat Imagery",
    "abstract": "The Landsat program is the longest-running Earth observation program in history, with 50+ years of data acquisition by 8 satellites. The multispectral imagery captured by sensors onboard these satellites is critical for a wide range of scientific fields. Despite the increasing popularity of deep learning and remote sensing, the majority of researchers still use decision trees and random forests for Landsat image analysis due to the prevalence of small labeled datasets and lack of foundation models. In this paper, we introduce SSL4EO-L, the first ever dataset designed for Self-Supervised Learning for Earth Observation for the Landsat family of satellites (including 3 sensors and 2 product levels) and the largest Landsat dataset in history (5M image patches). Additionally, we modernize and re-release the L7 Irish and L8 Biome cloud detection datasets, and introduce the first ML benchmark datasets for Landsats 4-5 TM and Landsat 7 ETM+ SR. Finally, we pre-train the first foundation models for Landsat imagery using SSL4EO-L and evaluate their performance on multiple semantic segmentation tasks. All datasets and model weights are available via the TorchGeo (https://github.com/microsoft/torchgeo) library, making reproducibility and experimentation easy, and enabling scientific advancements in the burgeoning field of remote sensing for a multitude of downstream applications.",

To bridge this gap, we introduce AstroLLaMA, a 7-billion-parameter model fine-tuned from LLaMA-2 using over 300,000 astronomy abstracts from arXiv. Optimized for traditional causal language modeling, AstroLLaMA achieves a 30% lower perplexity than Llama-2, showing marked domain adaptation. Our model generates more insightful and scientifically relevant text completions and embedding extraction than state-of-the-arts foundation models despite having significantly fewer parameters. AstroLLaMA serves as a robust, domain-specific model with broad fine-tuning potential.

    "title": "On “Scientific Debt” in NLP: A Case for More Rigour in Language Model Pre-Training Research",
    "abstract": "This evidence-based position paper critiques current research practices within the language model pre-training literature. Despite rapid recent progress afforded by increasingly better pre-trained language models (PLMs), current PLM research practices often conflate different possible sources of model improvement, without conducting proper ablation studies and principled comparisons between different models under comparable conditions. These practices (i) leave us ill-equipped to understand which pre-training approaches should be used under what circumstances; (ii) impede reproducibility and credit assignment; and (iii) render it difficult to understand: “How exactly does each factor contribute to the progress that we have today?” We provide a case in point by revisiting the success of BERT over its baselines, ELMo and GPT-1, and demonstrate how — under comparable conditions where the baselines are tuned to a similar extent — these baselines (and even-simpler variants thereof) can, in fact, achieve competitive or better performance than BERT. These findings demonstrate how disentangling different factors of model improvements can lead to valuable new insights. We conclude with recommendations for how to encourage and incentivize this line of work, and accelerate progress towards a better and more systematic understanding of what factors drive the progress of our foundation models today.",

    "title": "InternVideo: General Video Foundation Models via Generative and Discriminative Learning",
    "abstract": "The foundation models have recently shown excellent performance on a variety of downstream tasks in computer vision. However, most existing vision foundation models simply focus on image-level pretraining and adpation, which are limited for dynamic and complex video-level understanding tasks. To fill the gap, we present general video foundation models, InternVideo, by taking advantage of both generative and discriminative self-supervised video learning. Specifically, InternVideo efficiently explores masked video modeling and video-language contrastive learning as the pretraining objectives, and selectively coordinates video representations of these two complementary frameworks in a learnable manner to boost various video applications. Without bells and whistles, InternVideo achieves state-of-the-art performance on 39 video datasets from extensive tasks including video action recognition/detection, video-language alignment, and open-world video applications. Especially, our methods can obtain 91.1% and 77.2% top-1 accuracy on the challenging Kinetics-400 and Something-Something V2 benchmarks, respectively. All of these results effectively show the generality of our InternVideo for video understanding. The code will be released at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/InternVideo .",

    "abstract": "This article discusses the opportunities, applications and future directions of large-scale pretrained models, i.e., foundation models, which promise to significantly improve the analysis of medical images. Medical foundation models have immense potential in solving a wide range of downstream tasks, as they can help to accelerate the development of accurate and robust models, reduce the dependence on large amounts of labeled data, preserve the privacy and confidentiality of patient data. Specifically, we illustrate the \"spectrum\" of medical foundation models, ranging from general imaging models, modality-specific models, to organ/task-specific models, and highlight their challenges, opportunities and applications. We also discuss how foundation models can be leveraged in downstream medical tasks to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of medical image analysis, leading to more precise diagnosis and treatment decisions.",

    "title": "A Novel Scenarios Engineering Methodology for Foundation Models in Metaverse",
    "abstract": "Foundation models are used to train a broad system of general data to build adaptations to new bottlenecks. Typically, they contain hundreds of billions of hyperparameters that have been trained with hundreds of gigabytes of data. However, this type of black-box vulnerability places foundation models at risk of data poisoning attacks that are designed to pass on misinformation or purposely introduce machine bias. Moreover, ordinary researchers have not been able to completely participate due to the rise in deployment standards. This study introduces the theoretical framework of scenarios engineering (SE) for building accessible and reliable foundation models in metaverse, namely, “SE-enabled foundation models in metaverse.” Particularly, the research framework comprises a six-layer architecture (infrastructure layer, operation layer, knowledge layer, intelligence layer, management layer, and interaction layer), which can provide controllability, trustworthiness, and interactivity for the foundation models in metaverse. This creates closed-loop, virtual–real, and human–machine environments that provides the best indices and goals for the foundation models, which allows us to fully validate and calibrate the corresponding models. Then, examples of use cases from the automotive industry are listed to provide transparency on the possible use and benefits of our approach. Finally, the open research topics of related frameworks are discussed.",

    "title": "Nonlinear dynamic stability analysis of CNTs reinforced piezoelectric viscoelastic composite nano/micro plate under multiple physical fields resting on smart foundation",
    "abstract": "This study analyzes the nonlinear dynamic stability of carbon nanotube reinforced composite (CNTRC) piezoelectric viscoelastic nano/micro plate under time dependent harmonic compressive biaxial mechanical loading. The nano/micro plate is single-layer with a uniform and rectangular cross section. Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) is the material used for the nano/micro plate. Also, it is located on a nonlinear viscoelastic piezoelectric foundation made of Zinc Oxide (ZnO). Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) have been used to strengthen nano/micro plate. Using Kelvin-Voigt model, the material properties of the system are assumed to be viscoelastic. Nano/micro plate is subjected to 2D magnetic field and electric potential. Magnetic field effects are incorporated using Maxwell’s relations. An alternating and direct voltage is applied to the nano/micro plate and also smart foundation in thickness direction. Eshelby-Mori-Tanaka approach is used to estimate the effective elastic properties. Additionally, follower force and uniform thermal gradient is applied to nano/micro plate in this study. The nonlinear strain–displacement relations are based on the Von-Kármán theory. According to classical, first order, third order, sinusoidal, parabolic, hyperbolic and exponential shear deformation plate theories, a new formulation is proposed incorporating surface stress effects through the Gurtin-Murdoch elasticity theory. In order to consider small scale parameters, this research is based on modified strain gradient theory (MSGT). Using the energy method and Hamilton’s principle, the non classical governing equations are derived. For nano/micro plate, simply supported boundary conditions are considered. For the purpose of solving differential equations, an analysis based on Galerkin procedure and finally the Bolotin method will be used to obtain the dynamic instability region (DIR). It is the objective of this study to investigate the impact of such parameters as small-scale parameters, alternating and direct applied voltage, intensity of magnetic field, surface effects, thermal environment and static load factor on the DIR. This study revealed that taking into account the smart foundation reduces the area of dynamic instability region by more than 60% for a constant intensity of magnetic field. The stability responses are also more convergent with the smart foundation. Additionally, the range is moved toward higher excitation frequencies and greater system stability. Validation of answers based on reliable scientific articles is one of the final stages of this research. These results can be used to design nano/micro electromechanical systems.",

    "title": "Field Studies of the Stressed State of the «soil base – combined pile raft foundation» System of the Multifunctional Complex in Kharkiv City",
    "abstract": "In the projects of buildings and structures, in the last two to twenty-five years, in world practice, the so-called combined pile raft foundation (CPRF) is increasingly used, for which, in the design and calculations, it is assumed that the calculated load from the building is distributed between the piles and the raft, allowing up to 50% inclusion in the work (resistance) of the raft. As part of the scientific and technical support [1-8] of the construction object, instrumental automated monitoring of the stress state of the «soil foundation - combined pile raft foundation» system of the multifunctional complex on St. Pushkinska, 2 in Kharkiv (Ukraine) is carried out. The building has 7 floors and a mezzanine floor, including 2 floors of underground parking, 5 floors of shopping and entertainment area. There is a parking lot on the first 2 floors. The building system is a monolithic reinforced concrete frame with beamless floor slabs. The foundation of the building is a combined pile raft foundation with the centering of bored piles under the load-bearing elements of the frame. The soil base is represented by Quaternary alluvial-deluvial sediments – loams, sands and clays. As part of the implementation of the project, 23 sensors of two types were installed during the zero-cycle construction works: strain gauges (Geosense, England) to determine the stresses in the shafts of bored piles and in the upper and lower grids of the raft reinforcement and soil pressure sensors (Geokon, USA), which were placed under the sole of the raft. The results of the monitoring showed that the actual pressure under the raft does not exceed the pressure from its own weight of the raft (≈25kN/m2), which indicates the absence of inclusion in the work of the raft due to insignificant relative settlements of the combined pile raft foundation. Taking this fact into account when modeling the \"base - foundation - structure\" system and calculation in the SOFiSTiK showed a qualitative and quantitative convergence of effort values in reinforced concrete structures of a combined pile raft foundation.",

    "title": "Study on the Analysis of Pile Foundation Deformation and Control Methods during the Excavation of Deep and Thick Sludge Pits",
    "abstract": "This study aims to apply performance-based safety-assessment methods to the monitoring and numerical simulation of excavation engineering projects in order to comprehensively enhance engineering risk management and decision support. In this paper, a deep excavation project in Hefei with thick silty clay layers was studied. The analysis included the surface settlement, the deformation of support structures, the vertical and horizontal displacements of pile tops, axial forces in steel braces, settlement, and the horizontal displacement of a gravity retaining wall on the south side of the excavation using field-monitoring data. A refined three-dimensional finite element model was established to further analyze the distribution of uplift displacement at the bottom of the excavation, horizontal displacement, and bending moments of piles based on simulation results. The research findings indicate that phased excavation can reduce the spatial extent of disturbance to the surrounding soil caused by excavation. Additionally, the closer the location to the excavation and the thicker the underlying silty clay layer, the faster the rate of settlement change and the greater the surface settlement. The spatial structure formed by steel braces and pile foundations effectively reduced the horizontal displacement of the engineering piles. The study’s use of field monitoring and finite element simulation provided valuable insights into the deformation of support structures and the response of the surrounding soil to excavation, confirming the rationality and applicability of the support structure in this paper. The proposed method can serve as a reference for similar complex stratum excavation design and construction. The performance-based safety assessment is introduced, and the monitoring data, numerical simulation results, and performance targets are comprehensively analyzed to provide a reliable scientific basis for engineering decision making.",

    "title": "Numerical Simulation Study on the Impact of Deep Foundation Pit Excavation on Adjacent Rail Transit Structures—A Case Study",
    "abstract": "Excavation in foundation pits can result in serious issues for nearby tunnel structures like deformation, differential settlement, and seepage damage, which profoundly impact project timelines and potentially endanger life and property safety. Therefore, it is imperative to investigate these impacts before and after construction and to facilitate timely adjustments of construction measures and reinforcement where possible. In this study, a foundation pit construction project near a rail transit line is employed as a case to comprehensive study the impact of on-site deep foundation pit excavation on adjacent rail transit structures by numerical simulation. A three-dimensional finite-element model of the foundation pit based on site geological characteristics and construction procedures is established to study the excavation and maintenance processes. Through analysis of key parameters including soil deformation, displacement, shear force, and bending moment of the tunnel structures, the designed protective structure is found to have effectively mitigated soil deformation, ensuring the stability of the foundation pit. As excavation progresses, lateral soil deformation and vertical uplift gradually increase but remain within specified control values. During various excavation stages, the maximum displacement of the tunnel structure gradually increases, with the increase rates of maximum settlement being 29.09%, 20.51%, and 6.45%, respectively. This indicates a gradual enhancement of the stability of the tunnel structure. Additionally, excavation of the foundation pit has a significant impact on the bending moment distribution of the tunnel structure but does not affect the axial force and shear force of the tunnel structure. The findings of this study offer crucial scientific insights for evaluating the safety and stability of construction near tunnel structures.",

    "abstract": "The manuscript analyzes the impact of a non-contact underwater explosion on the foundation of a 35 mm naval cannon mounted on board a Project 258 minehunter. The finite element method was used to complete the task. Cole’s empirical formulas were used to describe the distribution of the pressure wave from the explosion of the TNT charge in water as a function of distance, time, and mass. The hull geometry was reflected based on technical documentation as a shell structure reinforced with beam-bar elements. Devices with large weights were represented as rigid bodies. Simplifications were used to minimize the number of degrees of freedom. The construction of ship’s hull is made of non-magnetic austenitic steel. The dynamic characteristics of this steel were determined based on static and dynamic tensile tests. The Johnson-Cook constitutive model was used to describe the mate - rial properties of steel. As part of the work, the impact resistance study of marine structures was presented, how it is defined by the existing regulations in the Polish Navy was considered, and the scope of their applicability was given. The scientific innovation of the presented work consists of checking and specifying the guidelines for designing and constructing warships.",

    "title": "DeepSNR: A deep learning foundation for offline gravitational wave detection",
    "abstract": "All scientific claims of gravitational wave discovery to date rely on the offline statistical analysis of candidate observations in order to quantify significance relative to background processes. The current foundation in such offline detection pipelines in experiments at LIGO is the matched-filter algorithm, which produces a signal-to-noise-ratio-based statistic for ranking candidate observations. Existing deep-learning-based attempts to detect gravitational waves, which have shown promise in both signal sensitivity and computational efficiency, output probability scores. However, probability scores are not easily integrated into discovery workflows, limiting the use of deep learning thus far to non-discovery-oriented applications. In this paper, the Deep Learning Signal-to-Noise Ratio (DeepSNR) detection pipeline, which uses a novel method for generating a signal-to-noise ratio ranking statistic from deep learning classifiers, is introduced, providing the first foundation for the use of deep learning algorithms in discovery-oriented pipelines. The performance of DeepSNR is demonstrated by identifying binary black hole merger candidates versus noise sources in open LIGO data from the first observation run. High-fidelity simulations of the LIGO detector responses are used to present the first sensitivity estimates of deep learning models in terms of physical observables. The robustness of DeepSNR under various experimental considerations is also investigated. The results pave the way for DeepSNR to be used in the scientific discovery of gravitational waves and rare signals in broader contexts, potentially enabling the detection of fainter signals and never-before-observed phenomena.",

    "title": "Pathways to a Shiny Future: Building the Foundation for Computational Physical Chemistry and Biophysics in 2050",
    "abstract": "In the last quarter-century, the field of molecular dynamics (MD) has undergone a remarkable transformation, propelled by substantial enhancements in software, hardware, and underlying methodologies. In this Perspective, we contemplate the future trajectory of MD simulations and their possible look at the year 2050. We spotlight the pivotal role of artificial intelligence (AI) in shaping the future of MD and the broader field of computational physical chemistry. We outline critical strategies and initiatives that are essential for the seamless integration of such technologies. Our discussion delves into topics like multiscale modeling, adept management of ever-increasing data deluge, the establishment of centralized simulation databases, and the autonomous refinement, cross-validation, and self-expansion of these repositories. The successful implementation of these advancements requires scientific transparency, a cautiously optimistic approach to interpreting AI-driven simulations and their analysis, and a mindset that prioritizes knowledge-motivated research alongside AI-enhanced big data exploration. While history reminds us that the trajectory of technological progress can be unpredictable, this Perspective offers guidance on preparedness and proactive measures, aiming to steer future advancements in the most beneficial and successful direction.",

    "title": "The Primary Nursing Care Model and Inpatients’ Nursing-Sensitive Outcomes: A Systematic Review and Narrative Synthesis of Quantitative Studies",
    "abstract": "Background: The delivery of quality, safe, and patient-centered care is foundational for professional practice. The primary nursing model allows nurses to have excellent knowledge about patients and families and to plan and coordinate care from admission to discharge, with better management of health situations. Nurses play a crucial role in improving patients’ outcomes, namely those sensitive to nursing care. The knowledge of the relationship between the primary nursing model and the nursing-sensitive outcomes provides new scientific evidence that strengthens the relevance of this nursing care organization model in the inpatients’ health outcomes. This systematic review describes the relationship between nurse-sensitive inpatients’ outcomes and the primary nursing care model. Methods: A systematic review was conducted with a narrative synthesis, and the following databases were searched: MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science, Nursing & Allied Health Collection, SciELO Collections, and Cochrane. Results: A total of 22 full texts were assessed, of which five were included in the study according to the selection criteria. The analysis results indicated that the primary nursing care model was related to nursing-sensitive patient safety outcomes. Patients’ experience was also considered a nursing-sensitive outcome, namely in the satisfaction with nursing care. Conclusion: The negative outcomes are clearly related to the primary nursing care model. There is scarce research that relates primary nursing to positive outcomes, such as patients’ functional status and self-care abilities, and more studies are needed.",

This understanding will be rendered through MATLAB and SIMULINK models, simulating both ideal and practical as well as noiseless and noisy conditions during the modulation/demodulation process. The simulation models will differentiate between the modulation methods adopted to generate ideal rectangular as well as practical trapezoidal waveforms for the Manchester coded signal. The analysis of the simulation results will describe the mechanisms through which distortion induced by additive white Gaussian noise can be eliminated during the demodulation process either by using recursive filters, such as a Kalman filter, or by calculating wave energy levels in specific time intervals.",

    "abstract": "The application and evaluation of single cell foundational models (scFMs) present significant challenges stemming from the heterogeneity of architectural frameworks and coding standards. To address these issues, we introduce BioLLM, a framework facilitating the integration and application of scFMs in single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis. BioLLM provides a universal interface, bridging diverse scFMs into a seamless ecosystem. By mitigating architectural disparities and coding conventions, it empowers researchers with streamlined access to scFMs. With standardized APIs and comprehensive documentation, BioLLM streamlines model switching and comparative analyses, while incorporating best practices for consistent model evaluation. Our comprehensive evaluation of scFMs revealed distinct strengths and limitations, highlighting scGPT’s robust performance across all tasks, both in zero-shot and fine-tuning scenarios. Geneformer and scFoundation also demonstrated strong capabilities in gene-level tasks, benefiting from effective pretraining strategies. In contrast, scBERT underperformed relative to other models, likely attributable to its considerably smaller parameter count and the limited size of the training dataset. Ultimately, BioLLM aims to empower the scientific community to leverage the full potential of foundational models, advancing our understanding of complex biological systems through enhanced single-cell analysis.",

    "title": "Visually sensitive seizures: An updated review by the Epilepsy Foundation",
    "abstract": "Light flashes, patterns, or color changes can provoke seizures in up to 1 in 4000 persons. Prevalence may be higher because of selection bias. The Epilepsy Foundation reviewed light‐induced seizures in 2005. Since then, images on social media, virtual reality, three‐dimensional (3D) movies, and the Internet have proliferated. Hundreds of studies have explored the mechanisms and presentations of photosensitive seizures, justifying an updated review. This literature summary derives from a nonsystematic literature review via PubMed using the terms “photosensitive” and “epilepsy.” The photoparoxysmal response (PPR) is an electroencephalography (EEG) phenomenon, and photosensitive seizures (PS) are seizures provoked by visual stimulation. Photosensitivity is more common in the young and in specific forms of generalized epilepsy. PS can coexist with spontaneous seizures. PS are hereditable and linked to recently identified genes. Brain imaging usually is normal, but special studies imaging white matter tracts demonstrate abnormal connectivity. Occipital cortex and connected regions are hyperexcitable in subjects with light‐provoked seizures. Mechanisms remain unclear. Video games, social media clips, occasional movies, and natural stimuli can provoke PS. Virtual reality and 3D images so far appear benign unless they contain specific provocative content, for example, flashes. Images with flashes brighter than 20 candelas/m2 at 3‐60 (particularly 15‐20) Hz occupying at least 10 to 25% of the visual field are a risk, as are red color flashes or oscillating stripes. Equipment to assay for these characteristics is probably underutilized. Prevention of seizures includes avoiding provocative stimuli, covering one eye, wearing dark glasses, sitting at least two meters from screens, reducing contrast, and taking certain antiseizure drugs. Measurement of PPR suppression in a photosensitivity model can screen putative antiseizure drugs. Some countries regulate media to reduce risk. Visually‐induced seizures remain significant public health hazards so they warrant ongoing scientific and regulatory efforts and public education.",

    "title": "Strategic Objectives of Sustainable Development Model in Production and Education",
    "abstract": "Purpose: The research aims to create a general economic-geographical model and explore its application possibilities using various criteria to achieve sustainable development in production and education. Introducing a new model is one of the most critical conditions since scientific research in this direction only partially solves the problem. In this regard, creating an economic-geographical model in production and education is very important. The model can positively affect the regulation of mutual relations of any economically developed countries with a favourable geographical position.\n \nTheoretical framework: The model we have presented can be applied from a theoretical point of view in creating new production areas, increasing personnel potential, and improving the quality of education. However, there is a need to conduct scientific research in this direction. Because in order to achieve the principles of stable and sustainable development in production and education, a favourable and accessible environment must first be formed so that people's social well-being and quality of life can reach a high level of development. Nevertheless, all forms of education provide us with a wealth of experience and information related to various scientific fields, as well as an understanding of the wider world and human interactions.\n \nDesign/methodology/approach: From a methodological point of view, several scientists and specialists deal with ways of developing production and education and their application mechanisms. In this direction, we approached the scientific works of N.A.Iskakov, L.N.Rodionova, Y.I.Vaisman, R.Jovovic, M.P.Todaro, Z.T.Imrani and others, their ideas and scientific results from a synergistic point of view. Besides these, there are different methods of approach in the field of production and education. Grouping methods were used: event, fact, cause and effect, as well as a deduction, systematic study of objects, synthesis of events and processes, characterizing production and education, comparison in determining optimal options, generalization, establishing interaction and in preparation of the model.\n \nFindings: In our modern times, economic power reflects the social and ecological components and the ability to produce products. In addition to production, this potential includes scientific and technical achievements and the level of education. The economic-geographical model of sustainable development in production and education can have different directions, but its advantage is related to meeting the minimum needs of people in the future by achieving complex development.\n \nResearch, Practical & Social implications: The economic-geographical model presented in the field of production and education can help to focus on many ideas based on political, economic, social as well as environmental sustainability at the local, regional and global levels. Geographical development is not only natural but also can lead to the solution of economic problems.\n \nOriginality/value: Aerospace, electronic, microbiological, biochemical and other fields, which have the latest scientific achievements and are equipped with technological equipment, occupy the most essential place in modern production. However, the most critical changes in the economy are related to the advanced development of professional services, information technology and scientific research. In this regard, the value of the research will be a foundation for undergraduate and graduate students, and the application of the model will allow for the exploration of many theories and applications of sustainable development in urban and rural areas.",

    "title": "Spatial–Temporal Characteristics and Influencing Factors of Land-Use Carbon Emissions: An Empirical Analysis Based on the GTWR Model",
    "abstract": "An in-depth comprehension of the spatial–temporal characteristics of land-use carbon emissions (LUCE), along with their potential influencing factors, is of high scientific significance for the realization of low-carbon land use and sustainable urban development. Academic investigations pertaining to LUCE predominantly encompass three key dimensions: assessment, optimization, and characterization research. This study aimed to investigate the spatial and temporal variations in LUCE within Zhejiang Province by analyzing data from 11 cities and identifying the key factors influencing these emissions. This research work employed the geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) model to explore the patterns of variation in these factors across each city. The results reveal that (1) the temporal changes in LUCE display two predominant trends, while the spatial distribution exhibits a distinct “high in the northeast and low in the southwest” divergence; (2) the average intensity of each factor follows the order of economic level > government intervention > urban compactness > public facilities level > urban greening level > industrial structure > population density; (3) and the influencing factors exhibit significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity, with varying direction and intensity of effects for different cities at different stages of development. This study integrated the dimensions of time and space, systematically examining the evolutionary trends of influencing factors on LUCE within each region. Consequently, it contributes to the comprehension of the spatiotemporal effects associated with the driving mechanisms of LUCE. Moreover, it offers a foundation for formulating customized patterns and strategies to mitigate such emissions, taking into account specific local contexts.",

    "title": "The Canadian Atmospheric Model version 5 (CanAM5.0.3)",
    "abstract": "Abstract. The Canadian Atmospheric Model version 5 (CanAM5) is the component of Canadian Earth System Model version 5 (CanESM5) which models atmospheric processes and coupling of the atmosphere with land and lake models. Described in this paper are the main features of CanAM5, with a focus on changes relative to the last major scientific version of the model (CanAM4). These changes are mostly related to improvements in radiative transfer, clouds, and aerosol parameterizations, as well as a major upgrade of the land surface and land carbon cycle models and addition of a small lake model. In addition to changes to parameterizations and models, changes in the adjustable parameters between CanAM4 and CanAM5 are documented. Finally, the mean climatology simulated by CanAM5 for the present day is evaluated against observations and compared with that simulated by CanAM4. Although many of the aspects of the simulated climate are similar between CanAM4 and CanAM5, there is a reduction in precipitation and temperature biases over the Amazonian basin, global cloud fraction biases, and solar and thermal cloud radiative effects, all of which are improvements relative to observations.\n",

    "title": "Physics-Guided, Physics-Informed, and Physics-Encoded Neural Networks in Scientific Computing",
    "abstract": "Recent breakthroughs in computing power have made it feasible to use machine learning and deep learning to advance scientific computing in many fields, including fluid mechanics, solid mechanics, materials science, etc. Neural networks, in particular, play a central role in this hybridization. Due to their intrinsic architecture, conventional neural networks cannot be successfully trained and scoped when data is sparse, which is the case in many scientific and engineering domains. Nonetheless, neural networks provide a solid foundation to respect physics-driven or knowledge-based constraints during training. Generally speaking, there are three distinct neural network frameworks to enforce the underlying physics: (i) physics-guided neural networks (PgNNs), (ii) physics-informed neural networks (PiNNs), and (iii) physics-encoded neural networks (PeNNs). These methods provide distinct advantages for accelerating the numerical modeling of complex multiscale multi-physics phenomena. In addition, the recent developments in neural operators (NOs) add another dimension to these new simulation paradigms, especially when the real-time prediction of complex multi-physics systems is required. All these models also come with their own unique drawbacks and limitations that call for further fundamental research. This study aims to present a review of the four neural network frameworks (i.e., PgNNs, PiNNs, PeNNs, and NOs) used in scientific computing research. The state-of-the-art architectures and their applications are reviewed, limitations are discussed, and future research opportunities in terms of improving algorithms, considering causalities, expanding applications, and coupling scientific and deep learning solvers are presented. This critical review provides researchers and engineers with a solid starting point to comprehend how to integrate different layers of physics into neural networks.",

    "title": "Effectiveness of Generative Artificial Intelligence for Scientific Content Analysis",
    "abstract": "Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in general, and large language models (LLMs) in particular, are highly fashionable. As they have the ability to generate coherent output based on prompts in natural language, they are promoted as tools to free knowledge workers from tedious tasks such as content writing, customer support and routine computer code generation. Unsurprisingly, their application is also attractive to professionals in the research domain, where mundane and laborious tasks, such as literature screening, are commonplace. We evaluate Vertex AI ‘text-bison’, a foundational LLM model, in a real-world academic scenario by replicating parts of a popular systematic review in the information management domain. By comparing the results of a zero-shot LLM-based approach with those of the original study, we gather evidence on the suitability of state-of-the-art general-purpose LLMs for the analysis of scientific content. We show that the LLM-based approach delivers good scientific content analysis performance for a general classification problem (ACC =0.9), acceptable performance for a domain-specific classification problem (ACC =0.8) and borderline performance for a text comprehension problem (ACC ≈0.69). We conclude that some content analysis tasks with moderate accuracy requirements may be supported by current LLMs. As the technology will evolve rapidly in the foreseeable future, studies on large corpora, where some inaccuracies are tolerable, or workflows that prepare large data sets for human processing, may increasingly benefit from the capabilities of GenAI.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of the study is to substantiate the theoretical aspect of the distance model of socialization. The conducted theoretical analysis discloses the relationship between the growing popularity of virtual internet space and the emergence of new online social activities and form social interaction between individuals which proves that the internet has become a dynamic new environment of personality socialization. Based on an analysis of the theoretical provisions of socialization, the authors refine the essence of the concept of the distance socialization model. The paper gives substantiation to the provision that the distance model of socialization creates the conditions for a developing personality to express its social activity in relation to social action, inaction or social deeds through the mechanism of social expression. This distance mechanism is also present in the real social space, yet in the distance model of socialization on the web, it becomes predominantly relevant dominates and leads. The authors suggest that within the distance model of socialization, this mechanism becomes the basis for the construction of an individual’s virtual identity and its online social space as well as a foundation for the expansion of the individual's social experience in the real social space.",

    "title": "Impact of Ecological Restoration Project on Water Conservation Function of Qilian Mountains Based on InVEST Model—A Case Study of the Upper Reaches of Shiyang River Basin",
    "abstract": "Scientifically evaluating the influence of ecological restoration projects on the water conservation function (WCF) of regional ecosystems is the foundation for formulating regional ecological restoration policies and optimizing and adjusting ecological restoration projects. In this paper, we considered fully the runoff generation and confluence process in the Qilian Mountains with the actual situation of the basin and re-rated the parameter Z to improve the simulation accuracy of InVEST model. On this basis, the impact of ecological restoration project on the WCF in the upper reaches of Shiyang River Basin (SRB) in the eastern part of Qilian Mountains was quantified. The results showed that, on the whole, the water conservation depth (WCD) of forest land was the largest (138.5 mm) and that of cultivated land was the smallest (24.78 mm), while the water conservation coefficient of forest land was also the largest (93.36%) and that of unused land was the smallest (16.67%). From 1986 to 2018, the WCD showed an increasing trend in the upper reaches of SRB, among them, the WCD in the western tributaries increased faster than that in the eastern tributaries from 1986 to 2000. The significantly increased areas were mainly distributed in the middle reaches of the western tributaries and the river source areas of the eastern tributaries, while the significantly decreased areas were mainly distributed in the river source areas of the western tributaries and the cultivated land expansion area in the middle reaches of the eastern tributaries. From 2000 to 2018, the WCD of the eastern tributaries increased more than that of the western tributaries. The significantly increased areas were mainly distributed in the four eastern tributaries, and the significantly decreased areas were scattered in the middle and lower reaches of each tributary. From 1986 to 2000, the overall influence of land use change on the increase in WCD was negative, while the influence of climate and land use change on the increase in water conservation were both positive from 2000 to 2018. The influence of land use change on WCD was different in different tributaries. Among them, that of the western tributaries (except the Dongda River) was positive in two different periods, while that of the eastern tributaries (except the Xiying River) was changed from negative to positive. The implementation of ecological restoration project was one of the main reasons for the improvement of WCF in Qilian Mountains from 2000 to 2018, with a contribution of 9.04%. In the future, the protection and restoration of decreased areas of WCF should be strengthened, and the Z value determined in this paper is expected to be applied in the arid inland river basins of northwest China.",

    "title": "Optimizing the evaluation model of green building management based on the concept of urban ecology and environment",
    "abstract": "Eco-city and green building are the global development strategies today. In order to improve the management level of green buildings in the urbanization process, a reciprocal symbiosis evaluation index model is proposed based on the theory of urban ecology. On this basis, the collaborative relationship model between Eco-city and green building is established, and the green building management framework based on the collaborative theory is constructed. The expert survey method was used to determine the evaluation indicators and analyze the relationship between various city subsystems. Then, the analytic hierarchy process is used to build a three-level evaluation index system, including the target layer, the criterion layer, and the index layer. The weight of the evaluation index system is calculated by combining of the chromatography method and the entropy weight method, and a scientific evaluation index system is established. The gray comprehensive evaluation method is used to evaluate the construction of the green building management system. Based on the index system, the analytic hierarchy process is used to calculate different weight coefficients, which makes the evaluation model easy to use and lays a foundation for subsequent research.",

    "title": "Optimising brain age estimation through transfer learning: A suite of pre‐trained foundation models for improved performance and generalisability in a clinical setting",
    "abstract": "Estimated age from brain MRI data has emerged as a promising biomarker of neurological health. However, the absence of large, diverse, and clinically representative training datasets, along with the complexity of managing heterogeneous MRI data, presents significant barriers to the development of accurate and generalisable models appropriate for clinical use. Here, we present a deep learning framework trained on routine clinical data (N up to 18,890, age range 18–96 years). We trained five separate models for accurate brain age prediction (all with mean absolute error ≤4.0 years, R2 ≥ .86) across five different MRI sequences (T2‐weighted, T2‐FLAIR, T1‐weighted, diffusion‐weighted, and gradient‐recalled echo T2*‐weighted). Our trained models offer dual functionality. First, they have the potential to be directly employed on clinical data. Second, they can be used as foundation models for further refinement to accommodate a range of other MRI sequences (and therefore a range of clinical scenarios which employ such sequences). This adaptation process, enabled by transfer learning, proved effective in our study across a range of MRI sequences and scan orientations, including those which differed considerably from the original training datasets. Crucially, our findings suggest that this approach remains viable even with limited data availability (as low as N = 25 for fine‐tuning), thus broadening the application of brain age estimation to more diverse clinical contexts and patient populations. By making these models publicly available, we aim to provide the scientific community with a versatile toolkit, promoting further research in brain age prediction and related areas.",

    "title": "Water Cycle Health Assessment Using the Combined Weights and Relative Preference Relationship VIKOR Model: A Case Study in the Zheng-Bian-Luo Region, Henan Province",
    "abstract": "Both the natural and social water cycles form part of the regional water cycle, and the assessment of the health of the social water cycle provides useful recommendations for resource allocation, urban planning, and development. The Zheng-Bian-Luo region (Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, Luoyang city cluster in China) is used as an example in this study. The three-level “goal criterion index” is used to develop a water cycle index system based on deeper knowledge of the notion of the social water cycle. The system has four criterion layers that measure water quantity, utility, quality, and ecology, in addition to 22 index levels regarding the total water resources and drinking water compliance rate. By using this as a foundation, the minimum information entropy principle was applied to couple AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) and EFAST (Extended Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Analysis) in order to calculate the comprehensive weights of the evaluation indicators and build a VIKOR (Intuitionistic Fuzzy Multi-attribute Decision Making Method) model of the relative preference relationship of the fused weights. This model was then compared to the conventional VIKOR model and the FCE (Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation Method) method in order to reflect on the objectivity of the evaluation results. The primary barriers preventing the improvement of water cycle health in the Zheng-Bian-Luo region were determined in this study by using the barrier degree model. The findings demonstrate that over the past 11 years, the overall water cycle health in the Zheng-Bian-Luo region has developed toward a healthy trend and that the water cycle health level in the region has gradually improved from the initial sub-pathological state to a healthy state. The results also demonstrate compliance with domestic drinking water sources, comprehensive water consumption per capita, the water consumption of CNY 10,000 of industrial-added value, the water consumption of CNY 10,000 of GDP, and the water consumption of CNY 10,000 for water. The primary barrier to the Zheng-Bian-Luo region’s improvement in water health is the water consumption ratio. The findings of this study can serve as a scientific foundation for creating a balanced urban water cycle and achieving long-term development in the area.",

    "title": "On the Efficiency and Robustness of Vibration-Based Foundation Models for IoT Sensing: A Case Study",
    "abstract": "This paper demonstrates the potential of vibration-based Foundation Models (FMs), pre-trained with unlabeled sensing data, to improve the robustness of run-time inference in (a class of) IoT applications. A case study is presented featuring a vehicle classification application using acoustic and seismic sensing. The work is motivated by the success of foundation models in the areas of natural language processing and computer vision, leading to generalizations of the FM concept to other domains as well, where significant amounts of unlabeled data exist that can be used for self-supervised pre-training. One such domain is IoT applications. Foundation models for selected sensing modalities in the IoT domain can be pre-trained in an environment-agnostic fashion using available unlabeled sensor data and then fine-tuned to the deployment at hand using a small amount of labeled data. The paper shows that the pre-training/fine-tuning approach improves the robustness of downstream inference and facilitates adaptation to different environmental conditions. More specifically, we present a case study in a real-world setting to evaluate a simple (vibration-based) FM-like model, called FOCAL, demonstrating its superior robustness and adaptation, compared to conventional supervised deep neural networks (DNNs). We also demonstrate its superior convergence over supervised solutions. Our findings highlight the advantages of vibration-based FMs (and FM-inspired self-supervised models in general) in terms of inference robustness, runtime efficiency, and model adaptation (via fine-tuning) in resource-limited IoT settings.",

    "abstract": "Abstract. The subglacial hydrological system affects (i) the motion of ice sheets through sliding, (ii) the location of lakes at the ice margin, and (iii) the ocean circulation by freshwater discharge directly at the grounding line or (iv) via rivers flowing over land.\nFor modeling this hydrology system, a previously developed porous-media concept called the confined–unconfined aquifer system (CUAS) is used. To allow for realistic simulations at the ice sheet scale,\nwe developed CUAS-MPI, an MPI-parallel C/C++ implementation of CUAS (MPI: Message Passing Interface), which employs the Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation (PETSc) infrastructure for handling grids and equation systems.\nWe validate the accuracy of the numerical results by comparing them with a set of analytical solutions to the model equations, which involve two types of boundary conditions. We then investigate the scaling behavior of CUAS-MPI and show that CUAS-MPI scales up to 3840 MPI processes running a realistic Greenland setup on the Lichtenberg HPC system.\nOur measurements also show that CUAS-MPI reaches a throughput comparable to that of ice sheet simulations, e.g., the Ice-sheet and Sea-level System Model (ISSM).\nLastly, we discuss opportunities for ice sheet modeling, explore future coupling possibilities of CUAS-MPI with other simulations, and consider throughput bottlenecks and limits of further scaling.\n",

    "title": "Research on construction schedule risk management of power supply and distribution projects based on MCS-AHP model",
    "abstract": "In order to manage the construction schedule risk of power supply and distribution engineering, a construction schedule risk evaluation model, namely the Monte Carlo simulation method - Analytic Hierarchy Process (MCS-AHP) model, is proposed. In this model, the Monte Carlo simulation method is adopted to improve the analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), and the normal distribution interval is used to replace the specific value when constructing the fuzzy complementary judgment matrix, to reduce the risk of fuzzy thinking and incomplete information or scattered data in the process of investigation and judgment and improve the scientific evaluation. This paper takes a power supply and distribution project in Guangdong Province as an example uses the MCS-AHP model to measure the key factors limiting the project progress, and uses the AHP method for comparative analysis, to verify the feasibility of the MCS-AHP model. The analysis shows that the key influencing factors are material and equipment procurement, production and arrival, installation of 10 kv high voltage switchboard, electrical acceptance and single machine commissioning, installation of low-voltage switchboard and DC switchboard, and foundation construction of power station equipment, etc., which are consistent with the actual situation. Therefore, it is feasible to construct the MCS-AHP model, which can provide a new way of thinking for schedule risk management analysis.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into encrypted computations using the CKKS (Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song) scheme, with a focus on multi-dimensional vector operations and real-world applications. Through two meticulously designed experiments, the study explores the potential of the CKKS scheme in Super Computing and its implications for data privacy and computational efficiency. The first experiment reveals the promising applicability of CKKS to matrix multiplication, indicating marginal differences in Euclidean distance and near-to-zero mean square error across various matrix sizes. The second experiment, applied to a wildfire dataset, illustrates the feasibility of using encrypted machine learning models without significant loss in accuracy. The insights gleaned from the research set a robust foundation for future innovations, including the potential for GPU acceleration in CKKS computations within TenSEAL. Challenges such as noise budget computation, accuracy loss in multiplication, and the distinct characteristics of arithmetic operations in the context of CKKS are also discussed. The paper serves as a vital step towards understanding the complexities and potentials of encrypted computations, with broad implications for secure data processing and privacy preservation in various scientific domains.",

    "abstract": "The properties of ice strength have a significant impact on the design and safety of structures in ice-infested waters. To analyze the flexural strength of columnar saline model ice, we conducted circular plate center loading tests at the Small Ice Model Basin of the China Ship Scientific Research Center (CSSRC SIMB) in China. The tests involved varying the loading rate and ice temperature, and a numerical model was developed using FEM and LS-DYNA for validation and comparison. The results of the tests revealed the crack propagation process, stress distribution, load response, and failure mode of the model ice. The model ice displayed typical brittle failure, and the flexural strength was linearly related to ice temperature but not significantly correlated with loading rate. The porosity of the model ice affected the load response and time of failure but not the failure mode. The model ice with 7% porosity had a 7.8% reduction in load response compared to the nonporous model ice. This study provides a reliable method for measuring and analyzing the flexural strength of model ice. It also serves as a foundation for further research on the interaction between structures and ice sheets.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nResearch is the scientific basis for the profession of dietetics, as it must be located and applied in evidence-based practice (EBP). EBP is often presented as a foundational skill for research. CEAR - Core, Evidence Application, Research - is a newly proposed model that separates Research and Evidence Application skills into distinct domains, jointly supported by a set of Core skills, thus acknowledging that education and advancement in one domain neither requires nor precipitates education and advancement in the other. The goal was to investigate the content and construct validity of the new CEAR Model.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA cross-sectional online survey of randomly selected dietitians in the United States was used to collect CEAR domain scores, validated measures of research or EBP skills and self-reported characteristics. Exploratory factor analysis, Cronbach's α and Pearson correlation between various tools and CEAR domains were used to assess validity and reliability. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and multiple linear regression between CEAR domains and participant characteristics were used to assess convergent and divergent validity.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOne hundred and fifty-four responses with a valid CEAR score were received and led to a three-factor solution, supporting the theorised differentiation of research from evidence application skills (content validity). Internal reliability for the CEAR Model overall and for each domain was high. The hypothesised correlations between existing research or EBP measurement tools and the relevant CEAR domains were found (construct validity). Known groups analysis demonstrated the expected differences in CEAR domain scores based on participant characteristics.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe CEAR Model demonstrates preliminary validity and internal reliability. It adds to the current literature by acknowledging the separateness of evidence application skills from research skills.",

    "title": "Analyzing the effects of quarantine, isolation, and vaccination on the spread of COVID-19 via a mathematical model",
    "abstract": "The main COVID-19 control strategies presently practiced are maintaining social distancing, quarantin-ing suspected exposures, and isolating infectious people. In this paper, a deterministic compartmental mathematical model is proposed considering these three control strategies. Based on the proposed model the effect of vaccination on the suppression of the disease is discussed. Critical vaccination rate and vaccinated population size relevant to disease suppression are determined based on the proposed mathematical model. Different forms of the most used key term in infectious disease modelling, reproduction number, are determined relevant to the proposed model. Sensitivity analysis of the reproduction numbers is done to identify model parameters mostly affecting the spread of the disease. Based on the reproduction number of the model disease controlling parameter regions are determined and graphical representations of those parameter regions are presented. Based on the results of the proposed mathematical model, it is observed that earlier implementation of the vaccination process is helpful to better control the disease. However, it takes considerable time to invent successful vaccinations for newly out-breaking diseases like COVID-19. Therefore, it took considerable time to start the vaccination process for COVID-19. It is observed that after starting a vaccination process at a particular rate it should continue until the vaccinated population reaches a critical size. © 2023, National Science Foundation.

    "title": "Bratislava School of Musicology as a Centre of Slavic Way of Thinking in Scientific and Artistic Work",
    "abstract": "The purpose of the work is to highlight the history of the formation and development of the Department of Musicology at Comenius University in Bratislava from its foundation in 1921 to the present day. The research methodology consists in the application of the historical method to study musicology as an academic discipline in relation to the historical context and to present a holistic picture of its development; biographical studies to outline the figures of the Slovak general cultural and special musicological school. The scientific novelty of the work lies in the characterisation of the Bratislava School of Musicology, which in the nineteenth century became the centre of musicology in Slovakia, developing traditional musicological problems and the methodology and practice of modern musical research. Conclusions. The article highlights the development of musicology as an academic discipline at Comenius University in Bratislava, its national and European musical traditions, which led to the emergence of the Slovak school of musicology, founded by Dobroslav Orel. The activities of the Czech D. Orel led to the emergence of a galaxy of Slovak musicologists and music historians who were brought up on the principles of the educational and scientific methodology of European academic education. This was the first generation of musicologists to receive a thorough professional education of the European model in their homeland. As a result of the active interaction of scholars of several generations, the traditions of a powerful scientific centre, Bratislava, strong in its combination of Europeanist breadth of education and pro-Slavic patriotic focus of its professional activities, were formed. \nKey words: Department of Musicology at Comenius University in Bratislava, student, lecturer, musicology education, European academic education.",

    "title": "Scientific and Technological Issues for the Intelligent Management of Air Traffic",
    "abstract": ": Air traffic is exhibiting the characteristics of large flow, strong coupling, and high time variation. To ensure its smooth, efficient, safe, and reliable operation, an intelligent model for air traffic management that features digitalization, automation, and collaboration needs to be developed. This study reviews the current and future demand for air traffic management and analyzes the challenges faced by traditional air traffic management from the aspects of traffic control, airspace management, and flow control. It also summarizes four basic scientific problems: interaction mechanism and mode between aircraft and air control infrastructure, air– ground coordinated control of aircraft intervals based on acceptable risks, airspace operation modeling and optimization considering multiple factors and based on non-uniform rules, and evolution mechanism and congestion propagation features of high-density air traffic flow. Moreover, it is suggested to integrate the application of satellite Internet, big data, digital twin, cloud computing, and other frontier technologies, and build an intelligent management technology system for air traffic from the aspects of aircraft, airspace, control decision-making, and operation, thereby laying a technical foundation for the construction of a next-generation air traffic management system.",

    "title": "Creative and Correct: Requesting Diverse Code Solutions from AI Foundation Models",
    "abstract": "AI foundation models have the capability to produce a wide array of responses to a single prompt, a feature that is highly beneficial in software engineering to generate diverse code solutions. However, this advantage introduces a significant trade-off between diversity and correctness. In software engineering tasks, diversity is key to exploring design spaces and fostering creativity, but the practical value of these solutions is heavily dependent on their correctness. Our study systematically investigates this trade-off using experiments with HumanEval tasks, exploring various parameter settings and prompting strategies. We assess the diversity of code solutions using similarity metrics from the code clone community. The study identifies combinations of parameters and strategies that strike an optimal balance between diversity and correctness, situated on the Pareto front of this trade-off space. These findings offer valu-able insights for software engineers on how to effectively use AI foundation models to generate code solutions that are diverse and accurate.",

    "title": "Optimal Reusable Rocket Landing Guidance: A Cutting-Edge Approach Integrating Scientific Machine Learning and Enhanced Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "This study presents an innovative approach that utilizes scientific machine learning and two types of enhanced neural networks for modeling a parametric guidance algorithm within the framework of ordinary differential equations to optimize the landing phase of reusable rockets. Our approach addresses various challenges, such as reducing prediction uncertainty, minimizing the need for extensive training data, improving convergence speed, decreasing computational complexity, and enhancing prediction accuracy for unseen data. We developed two distinct enhanced neural network architectures to achieve these objectives: Adaptive (AQResNet) and Rowdy Adaptive (RAQResNet) Quadratic Residual Neural Networks. These architectures exhibited outstanding performance in our simulations. Notably, the RAQResNet model achieved a validation loss approximately 300 times lower than the standard architecture with an equal number of trainable parameters and 50 times lower than the standard architecture with twice the number of trainable parameters. Furthermore, these models require significantly less computational power, enabling real-time computation on modern flight hardware. The inference times of our proposed models were measured in approximately microseconds on a single-board computer. Additionally, we conducted an extensive Monte Carlo analysis that considers a wide range of factors, extending beyond aerodynamic uncertainty, to assess the robustness of our models. The results demonstrate the impressive adaptability of our proposed guidance policy to new conditions and distributions outside the training domain. Overall, this study makes a substantial contribution to the field of reusable rocket landing guidance and establishes a foundation for future advancements.",

    "title": "Community-based Reconstruction and Simulation of a Full-scale Model of Region CA1 of Rat Hippocampus",
    "abstract": "The CA1 region of the hippocampus is one of the most studied regions of the rodent brain, thought to play an important role in cognitive functions such as memory and spatial navigation. Despite a wealth of experimental data on its structure and function, it has been challenging to reconcile information obtained from diverse experimental approaches. To address this challenge, we present a community-driven, full-scale in silico model of the rat CA1 that integrates a broad range of experimental data, from synapse to network, including the reconstruction of its principal afferents, the Schaffer collaterals, and a model of the effects that acetylcholine has on the system. We tested and validated each model component and the final network model, and made input data, assumptions, and strategies explicit and transparent. The unique flexibility of the model allows scientists to address a range of scientific questions. In this article, we describe the methods used to set up simulations that reproduce and extend in vitro and in vivo experiments. Among several applications in the article, we focus on theta rhythm, a prominent hippocampal oscillation associated with various behavioral correlates and use our computer model to reproduce and reconcile experimental findings. Finally, we make data, code and model available through the hippocampushub.eu portal, which also provides an extensive set of analyses of the model and a user-friendly interface to facilitate adoption and usage. This neuroscience community-driven model represents a valuable tool for integrating diverse experimental data and provides a foundation for further research into the complex workings of the hippocampal CA1 region.",

    "title": "Thermal Analysis of a Raft Concrete Foundation: A Case Study of a Leaking Ethane Tank",
    "abstract": "This article presents a case study on the thermal assessment of a reinforced concrete (RC) foundation exposed to low temperatures. The foundation supports a 19,500 m3-capacity tank with low-temperature (−89 °C) ethane. Icing and bubbling were observed on the tank’s surface soon after it started operations. Condensation was also observed at the bottom of the 0.8-m-depth RC slab, which raised concerns about the structural condition of the concrete. This study provides details of the field and analytical investigations conducted to assess the structural condition of the foundation. Heat transfer finite element (FE) analyses were performed to examine the concrete sections subjected to low temperatures. It was found that the ethane leakage produced a low temperature on the top side of the concrete foundation of +9.7 °C. Overall, the temperatures calculated by the FE analyses were in good agreement with actual field measurements, within a ±5% accuracy. The simplified heat transfer equation for porous media used in this study was sufficiently accurate to model the effects of the ethane leakage in the concrete foundation, provided that the ambient temperature at the site is taken into account in the analysis. The results also confirm that reinforcing bars can be neglected in the thermal analysis of massive concrete slabs. The results from the field measurements and FE analyses confirmed that the structural integrity of the RC foundation was never compromised. The approaches, methods and techniques discussed in this article are deemed suitable to solve the practical and scientific challenges involved in the thermal assessment and repairs of large special structures. Accordingly, they can serve as useful reference and guidance for engineers and practitioners working in the field of forensic engineering.",

    "abstract": "The need for early comprehension of scientific concepts in elementary school students is crucial. However, studies have indicated that some students lack a fundamental understanding of such concepts, highlighting the importance of effective teaching methods to improve scientific literacy at an early age. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the ability of Project-Based Learning in Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics (STEAM-PjBL) to improve students' scientific literacy, knowledge, and application of foundational scientific principles. A quasi-experimental methodology was employed, involving 22 female and 26 male fourth-grade elementary school students as participants. The study administered a Scientific Literacy Test (SLT) treatment to the students, followed by unpaired and paired t-tests to examine the impact of the STEAM-PjBL model on their scientific literacy skills. The results showed that STEAM-PjBL improved students' scientific literacy skills significantly more than traditional instruction. The experimental group outperformed the control group in the post-test, indicating the effectiveness of STEAM-PjBL. Therefore, the study recommends the adoption of the STEAM-PjBL model by elementary school teachers to improve students' understanding of fundamental scientific concepts.",

    "title": "The ICON-A model for direct QBO simulations on GPUs (version icon-cscs:baf28a514)",
    "abstract": "Abstract. Classical numerical models for the global atmosphere, as used for numerical weather forecasting or climate research, have been developed for conventional central processing unit (CPU) architectures. This hinders the employment of such models on current top-performing supercomputers, which achieve their computing power with hybrid architectures, mostly using graphics processing units (GPUs). Thus also scientific applications of such models are restricted to the lesser computer power of CPUs. Here we present the development of a GPU-enabled version of the ICON atmosphere model (ICON-A), motivated by a research project on the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO), a global-scale wind oscillation in the equatorial stratosphere that depends on a broad spectrum of atmospheric waves, which originates from tropical deep convection. Resolving the relevant scales, from a few kilometers to the size of the globe, is a formidable computational problem, which can only be realized now on top-performing supercomputers. This motivated porting ICON-A, in the specific configuration needed for the research project, in a first step to the GPU architecture of the Piz Daint computer at the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre and in a second step to the JUWELS Booster computer at the Forschungszentrum Jülich. On Piz Daint, the ported code achieves a single-node GPU vs. CPU speedup factor of 6.4 and allows for global experiments at a horizontal resolution of 5 km on 1024 computing nodes with 1 GPU per node with a turnover of 48 simulated days per day. On JUWELS Booster, the more modern hardware in combination with an upgraded code base allows for simulations at the same resolution on 128 computing nodes with 4 GPUs per node and a turnover of 133 simulated days per day. Additionally, the code still remains functional on CPUs, as is demonstrated by additional experiments on the Levante compute system at the German Climate Computing Center. While the application shows good weak scaling over the tested 16-fold increase in grid size and node count, making also higher resolved global simulations possible, the strong scaling on GPUs is relatively poor, which limits the options to increase turnover with more nodes. Initial experiments demonstrate that the ICON-A model can simulate downward-propagating QBO jets, which are driven by wave–mean flow interaction.\n",

    "title": "A novel Eulerian model based on central moments to simulate age and reactivity continua interacting with mixing processes",
    "abstract": "Abstract. In geoscientific models, simulating the properties associated with particles in a continuum can serve many scientific purposes, and this has commonly been addressed using Lagrangian models. As an alternative approach, we present an Eulerian method here: diffusion–advection–reaction type partial differential equations are derived for centralized moments, which can describe the distribution of properties associated with chemicals in reaction–transport models. When the property is age, the equations for centralized moments (unlike non-central moments) do not require terms to account for aging, making this method suitable for modeling age tracers. The properties described by the distributions may also represent kinetic variables affecting reaction rates. In practical applications, continuous distributions of ages and reactivities are resolved to simulate organic matter mineralization in surficial sediments, where macrofaunal and physical mixing processes typically dominate transport. In test simulations, mixing emerged as the predominant factor shaping reactivity and age distributions. Furthermore, the applications showcase the method's aptitude for modeling continua in mixed environments while also highlighting practical considerations and challenges.\n",

    "title": "Ocean Modeling with Adaptive REsolution (OMARE; version 1.0) – refactoring the NEMO model (version 4.0.1) with the parallel computing framework of JASMIN – Part 1: Adaptive grid refinement in an idealized double-gyre case",
    "abstract": "Abstract. High-resolution models have become widely available for the study of the ocean's small-scale processes.\nAlthough these models simulate more turbulent ocean dynamics and reduce uncertainties of parameterizations, they are not practical for long-term simulations, especially for climate studies.\nBesides scientific research, there are also growing needs from key applications for multi-resolution, flexible modeling capabilities.\nIn this study we introduce the Ocean Modeling with Adaptive REsolution (OMARE), which is based on refactoring Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean (NEMO) with the parallel computing framework of JASMIN (J parallel Adaptive Structured Mesh applications INfrastructure).\nOMARE supports adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) for the simulation of the multi-scale ocean processes with improved computability.\nWe construct an idealized, double-gyre test case, which simulates a western-boundary current system with seasonally changing atmospheric forcings.\nThis paper (Part 1) focuses on the ocean physics simulated by OMARE at two refinement scenarios: (1) 0.5–0.1∘ static refinement and the transition from laminar to turbulent, eddy-rich ocean, and (2) the short-term 0.1–0.02∘ AMR experiments, which focus on submesoscale processes.\nSpecifically, for the first scenario, we show that the ocean dynamics on the refined, 0.1∘ region is sensitive to the choice of refinement region within the low-resolution, 0.5∘ basin.\nFurthermore, for the refinement to 0.02∘, we adopt refinement criteria for AMR based on surface velocity and vorticity.\nResults show that temporally changing features at the ocean's mesoscale, as well as submesoscale process and its seasonality, are captured well through AMR.\nRelated topics and future plans of OMARE, including the upscaling of small-scale processes with AMR, are further discussed for further oceanography studies and applications.\n",

    "title": "Water balance model (WBM) v.1.0.0: a scalable gridded global hydrologic model with water-tracking functionality",
    "abstract": "Abstract. This paper describes the University of New Hampshire Water Balance Model, WBM, a process-based gridded global hydrologic model that simulates the land surface components of the global water cycle and includes water extraction for use in agriculture and domestic sectors. The WBM\nwas first published in 1989; here, we describe the first fully open-source\nWBM version (v.1.0.0). Earlier descriptions of WBM methods provide the foundation for the most recent model version that is detailed here. We present an overview of the\nmodel functionality, utility, and evaluation of simulated global river\ndischarge and irrigation water use. This new version adds a novel suite of\nwater source tracking modules that enable the analysis of flow-path histories on water supply. A key feature of WBM v.1.0.0 is the ability to identify the partitioning of sources for each stock or flux within the model. Three different categories of tracking are available: (1) primary inputs of water to the surface of the terrestrial hydrologic cycle (liquid precipitation, snowmelt, glacier melt, and unsustainable groundwater); (2) water that has been extracted for human use and returned to the terrestrial hydrologic system; and (3) runoff originating from user-defined spatial land units. Such component tracking provides a more fully transparent model in that users can identify the underlying mechanisms generating the simulated behavior. We find that WBM v.1.0.0 simulates global river discharge and irrigation water withdrawals well, even with default parameter settings, and for the first time, we are able to show how the simulation arrives at these fluxes by using the novel tracking functions.\n",

    "title": "A Foundation for Archival Engineering",
    "abstract": "Archives comprise information that individuals and organizations use in their activities. Archival theory is the intellectual framework for organizing, managing, preserving and access to archives both while they serve the needs of those who produce them and later when researchers consult them for other purposes. Archival theory is sometimes called archival science, but it does not constitute a modern science in the sense of a coherent body of knowledge formulated in a way that is appropriate for empirical testing and validation. Both archival theory and practice are seriously challenged by the spread and continuing changes in information technology and its increasing and increasingly diverse use in human activities. This article describes problems with and controversies in archival theory and advocates for a reformulation of concepts to address the digital challenge and to make the field more robust, both by addressing the problems and by enriching its capabilities by adopting concepts from other fields such as taxonomy, semiotics and systemic functional linguistics. The objective of this reformulation is to transform the discipline on the model of modern scientific method in a way that engenders a new discipline of archival engineering that is robust enough to guide the development of automated methods even in the face of continuing and unpredictable change in IT.",

    "abstract": "Centralised core facilities have evolved into vital components of life science research, transitioning from a primary focus on centralising equipment to ensuring access to technology experts across all facets of an experimental workflow. Herein, we put forward a seven‐pillar model to define what a core facility needs to meet its overarching goal of facilitating research. The seven equally weighted pillars are Technology, Core Facility Team, Training, Career Tracks, Technical Support, Community and Transparency. These seven pillars stand on a solid foundation of cultural, operational and framework policies including the elements of transparent and stable funding strategies, modern human resources support, progressive facility leadership and management as well as clear institute strategies and policies. This foundation, among other things, ensures a tight alignment of the core facilities to the vision and mission of the institute. To future‐proof core facilities, it is crucial to foster all seven of these pillars, particularly focusing on newly identified pillars such as career tracks, thus enabling core facilities to continue supporting research and catalysing scientific advancement.",

    "abstract": "Implementing quality tools and methods creates a basic foundation for innovations, sustainability, optimization, and competitiveness in the era of Industry 4.0 and Quality 4.0. This paper aimed to investigate the use of quality tools and methods in the 24 divisions of a mother manufacturing company without the influence of external factors such as geographical location (America, Africa, Asia, and Europe). It was important for the mother manufacturing company to implement a uniform process standard for innovation and performance. Research methods focused on using the Kanban card, Ishikawa diagram, affinity diagram, Flowchart, 5S, OPL, layout, and Pareto analysis. It was determined in this research that the synergy (combination) of quality tools and methods in divisions improves the process performance. This hypothesis was confirmed by the results of implementing quality tools in processes within divisions. A top result was the new innovative model of synergy of the quality tools and methods for divisions of the parent company thus filling a gap in the scientific field. This model created the basis for the uniform process standard in all divisions. The results brought improvements in the processes such as material input inspection, spare parts production, production process, and product packaging. This model could be a proactive instrument for process innovation.",

    "abstract": "The paper examines the scientific integration through the lens of TGKH. Muhammad Zainuddin Abdul Madjid. This study aims to explore the scientific integration model of TGKH Muhammad Zainuddin Abdul Madjid in the Nahdlatul Wathan educational institution. The study was conducted at the Shaykh Zainuddin Islamic Boarding School, the management center for the Nahdlatul Wathan organization. This study is a qualitative-descriptive study. Data were collected through interviews, observation, and documentation techniques, while data were analyzed using a sociological-historical approach. The analytical procedure used is the analysis procedure of Miles and Huberman. In this study, the scientific integration model proposed by TGKH Muhammad Zainuddin Abdul Madjid (Mawlana Shaykh) consists of three main components: 1) the integration of scientific knowledge with Islamic science and the Nahdlatul Wathan (Ke-NW-an) curriculum; 2) the institutional integration between Ma'had Darul Qur'an wal Hadith and higher education; 3) the integration of Islamic religious subjects with scientific disciplines. The findings of this study provide a foundation for policymakers to formulate more extensive and unified education strategies. This emphasises the significance of keeping an equilibrium between religious and scientific knowledge within the curriculum.",

    "title": "The Regional Aerosol Model Intercomparison Project (RAMIP)",
    "abstract": "Abstract. Changes in anthropogenic aerosol emissions have strongly contributed to global and regional trends in temperature, precipitation, and other climate characteristics and have been one of the dominant drivers of decadal trends in Asian and African precipitation. These and other influences on regional climate from changes in aerosol emissions are expected to continue and potentially strengthen in the coming decades. However, a combination of large uncertainties in emission pathways, radiative forcing, and the dynamical response to forcing makes anthropogenic aerosol a key factor in the spread of near-term climate projections, particularly on regional scales, and therefore an important one to constrain. For example, in terms of future emission pathways, the uncertainty in future global aerosol and precursor gas emissions by 2050 is as large as the total increase in emissions since 1850. In terms of aerosol effective radiative forcing, which remains the largest source of uncertainty in future climate change projections, CMIP6 models span a factor of 5, from −0.3 to −1.5 W m−2. Both of these sources of uncertainty are exacerbated on regional scales. The Regional Aerosol Model Intercomparison Project (RAMIP) will deliver experiments designed to quantify the role of regional aerosol emissions changes in near-term projections. This is unlike any prior MIP, where the focus has been on changes in global emissions and/or very idealised aerosol experiments. Perturbing regional emissions makes RAMIP novel from a scientific standpoint and links the intended analyses more directly to mitigation and adaptation policy issues. From a science perspective, there is limited information on how realistic regional aerosol emissions impact local as well as remote climate conditions. Here, RAMIP will enable an evaluation of the full range of potential influences of realistic and regionally varied aerosol emission changes on near-future climate. From the policy perspective, RAMIP addresses the burning question of how local and remote decisions affecting emissions of aerosols influence climate change in any given region. Here, RAMIP will provide the information needed to make direct links between regional climate policies and regional climate change. RAMIP experiments are designed to explore sensitivities to aerosol type and location and provide improved constraints on uncertainties driven by aerosol radiative forcing and the dynamical response to aerosol changes. The core experiments will assess the effects of differences in future global and regional (Africa and the Middle East, East Asia, North America and Europe, and South Asia) aerosol emission trajectories through 2051, while optional experiments will test the nonlinear effects of varying emission locations and aerosol types along this future trajectory. All experiments are based on the shared socioeconomic pathways and are intended to be performed with 6th Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) generation models, initialised from the CMIP6 historical experiments, to facilitate comparisons with existing projections. Requested outputs will enable the analysis of the role of aerosol in near-future changes in, for example, temperature and precipitation means and extremes, storms, and air quality.\n",

    "title": "Replicating a High-Impact Scientific Publication Using Systems of Large Language Models",
    "abstract": "Publications focused on scientific discoveries derived from analyzing large biological datasets typically follow the cycle of hypothesis generation, experimentation, and data interpretation. The reproduction of findings from such papers is crucial for confirming the validity of the scientific, statistical, and computational methods employed in the study, and it also facilitates the foundation for new research. By employing a multi-agent system composed of Large Language Models (LLMs), including both text and code generation agents built on OpenAI’s platform, our study attempts to reproduce the methodology and findings of a high-impact publication that investigated the expression of viral-entry-associated genes using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). The LLM system was critically evaluated against the analysis results from the original study, highlighting the system’s ability to perform simple statistical analysis tasks and literature reviews to establish the purpose of the analyses. However, we also identified significant challenges in the system, such as nondeterminism in code generation, difficulties in data procurement, and the limitations presented by context length and bias from the model’s inherent training data. By addressing these challenges and expanding on the system’s capabilities, we intend to contribute to the goal of automating scientific research for efficiency, reproducibility, and transparency, and to drive the discussion on the role of AI in scientific discovery.",

    "title": "Innovation of Management Mode of Private Colleges and Universities from the Perspective of Scientific Outlook on Development",
    "abstract": ": With the rapid development of higher education in China, private colleges have become an indispensable part of the higher education system. Guided by the concept of scientific development, the exploration of innovative management models for private colleges in the new era is urgently needed. This article firstly reviews the background, core content, and basic requirements of the scientific development concept, providing a theoretical foundation for the subsequent exploration of management models. Subsequently, the article analyzes the problems and challenges faced by private colleges in their development, such as the insufficiency of internal governance structure, inadequate rationality in resource allocation, the singularity of talent cultivation models, and the imperfection of internal management mechanisms. Building upon this analysis, the article proposes innovative ideas for the management models of private colleges that are in line with the scientific development concept. This includes the optimization of governance structure, the efficient allocation of educational resources, the diversification of talent cultivation programs, and the enhancement of internal management mechanisms, aiming to provide new perspectives and solutions for the sustainable and healthy development of private colleges.",
